## Future Vision: Cross-Platform Bookmark Archive

Long-term goal: Build self-maintaining importers for 20+ years of bookmarks across platforms.

**Platforms with bookmarks:**
- Twitter/X (partial Dewey export) — ✅ Custom fetcher built
- Reddit (partial Dewey export)
- YouTube (Dewey can't export) — Needed
- Tumblr
- Facebook (Dewey can't export) — Needed
- Pinterest
- TikTok
- Sora likes — ✅ Custom fetcher built

**Current approach:**
- getdewey.co for bulk export where supported
- Custom fetchers for gaps (Sora, Twitter replies)
- SQLite as storage layer
- **Obsidian as potential unified interface** (tips surging in this direction)

**Pattern emerging:**
Each platform needs: fetch script → incremental sync → SQLite storage → export utilities

This is the same pattern as Hall of Fake and claude-code-tips. The two current projects are pilots for this larger system.

## Weekly Check-in Log

### Week of 2025-12-29

**New adoptions:**
- ✅ GitHub MCP server configured
- ✅ Filesystem MCP server configured
- ✅ Playwright MCP for thread extraction
- ✅ SQLite migration for Hall of Fake (1,320 videos)
- ✅ SQLite migration for claude-code-tips (343 tweets)
- ✅ Engagement delta analysis
- ✅ ORCHESTRATOR.md pattern (self-invented)

**Key finding:**
Obsidian tips are surging (+600-912% growth). Community converging on Obsidian as Claude Code companion. Prioritize Obsidian integration for bookmark archive.

**Currently testing:**
- Separate planning/execution workflow
- Handoff delegation pattern
- Engagement tracking for tip adoption decisions

**Friction points:**
- Claude.ai Projects don't share context
- Large CapCut JSON files hard to read
- `is_curated` flag in DB is misleading (first batch, not quality)

**Next to try:**
- Obsidian session logging (#6)
- Obsidian as workspace (#12)
- Context clearing with "junior dev" framing (#9)
- CapCut Forge automation (Phase 7, blocked)

## Workflow Environments

Current usage pattern:

| Environment | Best For | Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Claude.ai Projects | Planning, organization, memory | Daily |
| Claude Code CLI | Autonomous execution | Per-task |
| Cursor Sidebar | Focused file questions | Frequent |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Trusted autonomous tasks | When delegating |
| Chrome Extension | Avoiding (too visual/lossy) | Rarely |
