## [!!] Act Now

High-signal tips directly applicable to current work.

- **@lydiahallie** (5,022 likes)
  Claude Code now supports agent teams (in research preview)

Instead of a single agent working through a task sequentiall
  *Why:* We actively delegate tasks to Claude Code but not as "agent teams" working in parallel. This feature could significantly change our execution workflows by allowing for parallel research, debugging, and building.
  *Action:* Enable agent teams in settings.json and experiment with parallelizing tasks in the hall-of-fake sibling repo, specifically video analysis and bug fixes.
  *Matches:* Delegation pattern: Claude.ai for planning, Claude Code for execution, Cross-project coordination with hall-of-fake sibling repo (potential to speed up video analysis and bug fixes)

- **@@PerceptualPeak** (4,632 likes) `/fork-detect`
  Smart forking allows Claude Code users to leverage context from past sessions for efficient feature implementation using `/fork-detect` and a vectorized RAG database.
  *Why:* This introduces a novel approach (smart forking) to leverage past Claude Code sessions for more efficient feature implementation, which we haven't explored. The use of embedding models and a vectorized RAG database to retrieve relevant context could significantly improve our workflow.
  *Action:* Investigate the feasibility and potential benefits of implementing smart forking in our workflow. Start by exploring the shared git repo if available.
  *Matches:* Directly addresses the problem of re-explaining context in new Claude Code sessions., Aligns with our goal of improving efficiency in cross-instance communication and knowledge reuse.

- **@@anthonyriera** (1,941 likes) `planning-with-files`
  The "Planning with files" Claude Code skill significantly improves project planning and execution by having Claude persistently reference markdown files containing task plans.
  *Why:* This introduces a specific Claude Code skill ('Planning with files') that seems to offer significant improvement in plan execution and reduced 'drift,' directly addressing a pain point in complex task management. Although we use file-based planning, the 'constant reminder' aspect achieved via this skill could be a game changer.
  *Action:* Immediately test the skill on a representative task to assess its effectiveness in reducing planning drift and improving execution accuracy. Compare its performance against our current file-based planning methods.
  *Matches:* Addresses planning drift, Leverages existing file-based planning workflow, Uses Claude Code skills

- **@@AI_Skiller** (700 likes) `code-simplifier`
  The Claude Code team released their `code-simplifier` plugin, powered by Opus, to automatically refactor and simplify code after it's written, accessible via command-line or in-session installation.
  *Why:* This is a new plugin from the Claude Code team itself that simplifies code automatically using Opus. The ability to simplify code automatically and reduce complexity is a novel technique that could immediately improve our code quality and readability, especially before PR submissions.
  *Action:* Install the plugin and test it on a complex piece of code from one of our projects (e.g., family_server.py in the hall-of-fake repo) to assess its effectiveness. Note the performance impact of automatic simplification on the Opus model.
  *Matches:* Directly addresses code quality and maintainability, which are always relevant to our projects., Potentially integrates into our pre-compact and session-end hooks for automatic wrap-up.

- **@@RohunJauhar** (640 likes) `vibe orchestration`
  Turn your AI assistant into a proactive employee by giving it broad autonomy and a mandate to improve your workflow while you sleep.
  *Why:* This demonstrates a workflow for AI self-improvement via online research and autonomous implementation, a technique we haven't explored. It showcases a higher level of autonomy and a specific instruction set for proactive daily improvements, going beyond our current delegation patterns.
  *Action:* Test this "vibe orchestration" approach with Claude Code to see if it can autonomously identify and implement improvements within our existing workflow. Focus on a limited scope: having Claude Code analyze our existing skills and propose enhancements. Then automate the creation of a PR for review.
  *Matches:* Autonomous daily bookmark monitor (analysis engine in progress), LLM-based tip classification for morning briefings, Delegation pattern: Claude.ai for planning, Claude Code for execution

- **@@alexhillman** (120 likes) `AI Slop Patterns`
  Optimize your Claude prompts for efficient, professional AI interactions by avoiding unnecessary affirmations, filler, and indirect language.
  *Why:* This outlines a standardized communication style for Claude Code that directly addresses common LLM verbosity and unproductive patterns. Implementing these guidelines could significantly improve efficiency and focus in our interactions with Claude Code.
  *Action:* Review and incorporate these guidelines into our standard Claude Code prompts and skills. Consider adding to our /create-skill meta-command to automatically include these preferences in new skill generation.
  *Matches:* Directly relevant to how we use Claude Code for task execution., Addresses issues with LLM verbosity that we've observed.
