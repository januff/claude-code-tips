## Summary

This Claude Code tip demonstrates a delayed or 'hook-triggered' prompt injection technique. It allows you to set up a prompt that influences the workflow at a later, often forgotten stage. By injecting a suggestive prompt, you can manipulate future steps without immediately executing the injection, which can be helpful for addressing workflow amnesia.
