## Summary

This Claude Code tip highlights using shared context within the Claude environment to streamline multi-file edits, rather than manually copying and pasting code snippets. By leveraging Claude's contextual understanding across files, developers can significantly reduce the time and effort typically spent managing argument passing and data synchronization between different parts of a project. This leads to a more efficient and less error-prone workflow when making changes across multiple code files.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `multi-file edits` · context, argument passing, manual copy-paste
