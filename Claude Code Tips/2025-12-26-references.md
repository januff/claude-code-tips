## Summary

This tip describes using a skill-based workflow by creating focused contexts for backend, frontend, or full-stack tasks. This is achieved through specific prompts (e.g. /backend) that load relevant file references using @ symbols. The key insight is to provide just enough context for the immediate task, streamlining the development process.
