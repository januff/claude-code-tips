## Summary

This tip highlights the decision to build a custom TUI (Text User Interface) due to unresolved bugs and a perceived focus on unnecessary features in an existing TUI application. The user's frustration stems from the original application's poor performance and lack of focus on core functionality, motivating them to create a better alternative. While no specific commands or tools are shown, the implied action is a complete overhaul of the TUI experience.
