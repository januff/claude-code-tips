## Summary

This tip showcases a workflow for using Claude to summarize tasks automatically. The user created a custom "ping" command to send Telegram messages and then instructed Claude to execute this command after each completed task. This results in Claude writing a task summary to stdout and then notifying the user via Telegram after every task completion, enabling real-time summaries.
