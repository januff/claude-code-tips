I think it's cool, and they can show me some amazing stuff that they can do with it. I'm thinking of @pedramamini as one of the heads of this pack, by the way. Absolutely absolutely brilliant stuff that he does with it.

> To me, text is the primitive. And Obsidian just becomes a UI layer on top of states and relationships that I want to see. In other words, I feel like I should just be able to express what I want to get out of Obsidian as context in a series of prompts, etc. And my AI system should be able to generate the output that I'm looking for. Ideally, my AI system should be able to generate any UI. It should be able to generate an Obsidian-like experience. It should be able to make me a web app. It should be able to do it on the mobile phone. Do you know what I mean?

## Summary

This tweet explores whether Obsidian is becoming obsolete due to advancements in AI. The author argues that text should be considered the core primitive, and AI should handle the UI and functionality currently provided by Obsidian. The core insight is that Obsidian may be a constraint, and AI could offer a more flexible and powerful way to manage and interact with knowledge.
