## Summary

This tip advocates for a strategic approach to coding with Claude, where the user provides a strong understanding of the problem and leverages Claude to generate the actual code. The key insight is to focus on conceptualizing the solution and guiding Claude's code generation, rather than getting bogged down in the syntax details. This method allows for faster development and greater overall control, even without specifying particular commands beyond prompting.
