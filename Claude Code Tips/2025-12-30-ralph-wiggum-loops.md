> Not to mention self-referential command injection, context monitoring, auto restore from clear, compaction-avoidance, continuous work with frictionless context management, and validators to keep Claude honest and focused across many context clears in intelligent recurring loops.

> I should probably do a podcast or video at some point when things settle down. And maybe share a plugin example. It’s pretty wild. Coding via CarPlay with a project manager agent that intelligently queues tasks for later, merges them, keeps looping until validated. Just like talking to a human. No more compaction. No more clear. Just like talking to a human. Sure you can type and read if you want, but you don’t have to. You’re untethered from the screen. Can pick up on your computer and step away and seemlessly keep going from your phone or Siri. 🤯🧘

## Summary

Unlock Claude's full coding potential by integrating Language Server Protocol (LSP) features, hooks, subagents, adversarial validations, and iterative loops. The combination of these techniques, including voice interaction (STT/TTS), creates a significantly more powerful and efficient coding workflow. Consider implementing these elements to dramatically improve your Claude coding experience.

> @EricBuess Yeah these are improvements… And how much of building that workflow is worth is vs just interacting with the model and solving problems? Most of the best things will become baked in within a few months, so it has to be a massive marginal improvement to be worth the up front time

> Speaking probably faster than typing, if stt is fully integrated into the context, which it isn’t (or CC takes audio directly now?).
