## Summary

This tip highlights the potential of the Claude Agent SDK to revolutionize knowledge work, similar to how Claude Code impacted software development. Building custom agents using the SDK now offers a significant advantage, creating a personalized and powerful toolset months ahead of wider public adoption. This early access provides a glimpse into the future of AI-powered personal assistance, almost like having personal AGI.

> @mckaywrigley I've been building with agents sdk but their ambiguity on it working with claude subscription long-term is worrying.  I assume it will keep working for personal use, but it's not really clearly spelled out. https://t.co/30iSOFEdib
