## Summary

This tip highlights the creator's workflow for the 'Ralph Wiggum Loop,' a yet-unidentified development process. The key insight is to prioritize foundational knowledge, building specifications, and lookup tables over relying solely on the Claude Code plugin. The workflow likely involves a structured approach to development, emphasizing a deep understanding of the basics rather than immediate plugin use.

> @memoria_2024 for the loop he just ran a script in PowerShell I believe, but the fundamental principle was to keep context small and use lookup tables for spec files and only work on one spec at a time

> @d4m1n Thanks. Insightful.  I will improve my practices already by starting new session between "write the spec" and " execute the https://t.co/6mn4aXTtCu " and keep terminal by task. I was assuming writing down md was enough. But manually have loop=terminal is a nice baby step
