> @d4m1n @doodlestein goes far beyond this. Unfortunately he's too busy building to create videos, but he shares a lot of wisdom on X. He also made this, which makes Ralph look primitive (and not in an elegant way): https://t.co/yI8brrlcSI

> @d4m1n Exactly. Plugins are fun, but real leverage comes from mastering the fundamentals first, then AI works for you, not the other way around.

> @memoria_2024 for the loop he just ran a script in PowerShell I believe, but the fundamental principle was to keep context small and use lookup tables for spec files and only work on one spec at a time
