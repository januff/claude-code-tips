## Summary

This tip presents two interactive workflow strategies using Claude. The first involves instructing Claude to "ask me questions until you're satisfied" to facilitate a deeper understanding of your initial prompt through clarifying questions. The second involves having Claude analyze documentation in one session, providing commentary, then using a separate session to edit based on alignment, allowing for thorough review and iterative refinement.
