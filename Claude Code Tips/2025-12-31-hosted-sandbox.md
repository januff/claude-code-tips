## Summary

The Claude Agent SDK empowers developers to create sophisticated agents equipped with diverse skills and tools. To build web applications, the SDK should run within a secure, hosted sandbox environment, which acts as a virtual computer for the agent. While setting up the sandbox might seem complex initially, you can use Claude Code itself to understand the documentation and streamline the process, leveraging provider options like E2B (recommended in the tweet) or others documented by Anthropic.

> @sean_infinnerty @stnkvcs yes. you’ll just need to store the token and feed it to the sandbox.

> @mckaywrigley @stnkvcs @e2b Would be great to see some real use cases/tutorials and their associated token costs going forward. Especially knowing when to use the other models rather than defaulting to Opus for proactive agents that run 24/7
