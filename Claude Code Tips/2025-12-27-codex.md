## Summary

This is a humorous, self-deprecating tweet implying the user has no real Claude Code (CC) tips to share, contrasting it with the (perhaps imagined) ability to use Codex. It jokingly suggests a hypothetical workflow switch, but provides no concrete advice or specific commands for improving CC usage. The tweet is purely for entertainment and doesn't offer any practical coding insights.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `codex` · CC, tricks, joke
