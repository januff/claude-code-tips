## Summary

This tip focuses on a "keep-it-simple-stupid" (KISS) approach to AI coding, dubbed the "Ralph Wiggum breakdown." The core idea is to simplify code development to facilitate faster and easier project completion, enabling users to "ship while you sleep." It appears this is achieved by breaking problems down into very simple, manageable steps.

> @mattpocockuk I've landed on pretty much the exact workflow, but I use a local sqlite database for task management and PRDs instead of a text file (epics and tasks). Mostly because it's way faster to query than reading and parse text files and supports more complex queries.

> [!reply] @sinuhet · Tue Jan 06 15:42:05 +0000 2026
> @mattpocockuk As you allow LLM to decide which task to choose next, why you cannot allow LLM to run 2-4 tasks in parallel IF all parallel tasks do not touch the same files? I do this with Cascade in Windsurf using worktrees and I never have  merge conflicts. What am I missing?

> [!reply] @kidiwalogha · Mon Jan 05 16:55:26 +0000 2026
> @mattpocockuk Followed the same principle like 6+ months ago to build an automated browsing agent that user speaks to in a natural language, breaks the user task to workflows, execute while documenting each flow, and report at the end of the progress and once done.

> [!reply] @sinuhet · Tue Jan 06 15:45:57 +0000 2026
> @mattpocockuk How can you make sure during design PRD a task is the correct size for LLM? Not too large and complex but also not too small? Or do you recheck the size of tasks during sprint before each task is started?

> [!reply] @sinuhet · Tue Jan 06 15:59:29 +0000 2026
> @mattpocockuk Do I get it right you have just one prompt for a single sprint of some 16 tasks and a prompt for each task is just a short description in the PRD file? That it is?
