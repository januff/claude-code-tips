## Summary

This tip focuses on a "keep-it-simple-stupid" (KISS) approach to AI coding, dubbed the "Ralph Wiggum breakdown." The core idea is to simplify code development to facilitate faster and easier project completion, enabling users to "ship while you sleep." It appears this is achieved by breaking problems down into very simple, manageable steps.

> @mattpocockuk I've landed on pretty much the exact workflow, but I use a local sqlite database for task management and PRDs instead of a text file (epics and tasks). Mostly because it's way faster to query than reading and parse text files and supports more complex queries.
