> Start a task, walk away. Your phone/watch rings when Claude is done, stuck, or needs a decision.

> Free &amp; open source (MIT). Underlying API costs are cents per minute of call. https://t.co/2FlZf9a5jW

## Summary

The CallMe plugin allows Claude Code to initiate phone calls to notify you about task completion, roadblocks, or decision points, enabling you to start a task and step away. This free and open-source tool leverages an external API for phone calls, which incurs minimal per-minute costs. By using CallMe, developers can free themselves from actively monitoring Claude, getting notified only when needed.

> @tayloramurphy @claudeai that wouldn’t work unfortunately, Claude permissions have to be given via terminal input rather than MCP server so CallMe can’t do that, you need to skip permissions for the best experience
