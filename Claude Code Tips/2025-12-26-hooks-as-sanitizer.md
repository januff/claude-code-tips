## Summary

This tip explores using "hooks" (likely referring to a programming concept, possibly React hooks) as a data sanitization technique before feeding input to Claude, aiming to reduce token usage and optimize context window. The insight is to leverage hooks for input compression, although specific hook types or implementation details are not provided. This could potentially lead to cost savings and improved performance by minimizing the amount of context Claude needs to process.
