## Summary

The tip suggests automating a process by converting it into a "pre auto compact hook." This approach likely involves integrating a custom script or action to run automatically before a compaction process, streamlining workflows. By leveraging hooks, users can customize and extend the default behavior of a system or tool. The specific tool is not mentioned, so this requires context.

> Created a custom slash command "/handover" in Claude Code: When I'm ending a Claude session (e.g. context window filling up), I get Claude to generate a "https://t.co/GZrCLFU2Zu" document which summarizes everything we did in this session, including decisions, pitfalls, lessons learned, etc. So the next session's Claude has full context.

> @pauloportella_ @zarazhangrui I was doing this manually by asking CC to "do an AI handoff", though it remembers to do it automatically after it completes major changes.

> This Claude Code /statusline is so helpful. Now I'm constantly reminded if the current session slips into "dumb zone" and context poisoning. If it does, I ask CC to save needed to AI handoff, run /clear, and pick up from what was just left off, but now context is green again: https://t.co/6J6ULX4ztD

> @pauloportella_ @zarazhangrui Isn't it what compact supposed to do in the first place? Compact thing is quite opaque for me
