## Summary

This Claude Code tip highlights several upcoming features planned for 2026, showcasing its advancements in agent-based collaboration and efficiency. Key improvements include agent swarms that can be deployed dynamically, a session search assistant using priority matching, collaborative agent tools with defined operations, and MCP (Modular Code Pack) search/loading via CLI for token reduction. These advancements suggest a focus on more powerful, collaborative, and resource-efficient agent workflows within Claude Code.

> Anthropic keeping the Claude Code harness closed source is surely a pain in the neck, but to be honest we haven't seen much improvement in the FOSS CLIs like Gemini CLI or Codex. Opencode is probably the only harness which gets as close to Claude Code as possible and even that has quite a lot of issues to be ironed out

> A lot of this sounds exciting, but the real thing to watch is coordination. Single agents already do a decent job. The hard part is getting multiple agents to share context, pass work around smoothly, and not get in each other’s way. It’s all about reducing overhead, not adding more features. If Claude Code gets this right, it stops being just a smart coding helper and starts to feel like a real dev setup where agents work like teammates. That’s the shift that actually matters in 2026, @nummanali
