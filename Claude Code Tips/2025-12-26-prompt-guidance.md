> When you are struggling with Claude code to do some tasks, take time and ask the model where you are failing to provide the right prompt to the model. The model is very smart, and they will provide you with guidance on how you can provide better prompts.

This allows Claude to provide guidance on how to rephrase or restructure your requests for better results, turning the model into a prompt engineering mentor.
