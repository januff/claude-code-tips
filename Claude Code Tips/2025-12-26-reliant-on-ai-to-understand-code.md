## Summary

This Claude code tip highlights the importance of developer understanding, advising that the reluctance to reset an AI assistant conversation often signals over-reliance. It suggests that if you're hesitant to clear the chat history, you may not fully grasp the code and are too dependent on the AI's context. The core takeaway is to prioritize code comprehension over continuous AI assistance for debugging or analysis.
