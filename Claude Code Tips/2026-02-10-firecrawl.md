## Summary

The Firecrawl plugin, now available in the Anthropic marketplace, allows you to scrape and extract data directly from websites within Claude Code. By using the `/plugin` command to install Firecrawl, you can instruct Claude to fetch specific web data for analysis. This eliminates the need for external scraping tools and streamlines web data integration into your Claude workflow.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `Firecrawl` · plugin, web data, scrape, extract, website, marketplace
## Classification

**NOTED** — We already have Firecrawl-like capabilities available to us via MCP servers. The tweet is simply announcing its availability as an official plugin which doesn't change our workflow.
