## Summary

This tip introduces a novel coding workflow leveraging CarPlay and an AI-powered project manager agent. It simulates human-like interaction by intelligently queuing tasks, merging code, and iterating until validated, eliminating the need for manual code compaction or clearing. This allows for voice-driven coding on-the-go, enhancing productivity.
