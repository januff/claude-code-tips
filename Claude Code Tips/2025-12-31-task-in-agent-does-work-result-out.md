## Summary

This Claude tip highlights a paradigm shift in computing where the user defines a task and receives a result without needing to manage the intermediate processing steps. It frames agent-based workflows as a new computing model where the complexities of implementation are abstracted away, simplifying the development process. The tip suggests a move towards simply providing input and receiving output, letting the agent handle the rest.
