## Summary

This Claude Code tip humorously suggests that expressing frustration, through swearing, can be a (non-technical) debugging technique when the model doesn't immediately produce the desired results. While not a practical solution, it highlights the iterative nature of prompt engineering and the emotional responses it can evoke. There are no specific commands or tools demonstrated; the tip is purely tongue-in-cheek.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `swear-at-it` · frustration, debugging, prompting, retry
