## Summary

This tip highlights a potentially highly profitable (though likely hyperbolic) combination of technologies for software development. It suggests that using Claude's most powerful model (Opus 4.5) in conjunction with tools like XcodeBuild (for iOS development) and Playwright (for end-to-end testing), possibly with an element of unorthodox, creative problem-solving (analogized by "Ralph Wiggum"), could lead to significant financial success. While light on specifics, the core idea is that this particular tech stack is potent and potentially underutilized.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `XcodeBuild` · Opus 4.5, playwright
