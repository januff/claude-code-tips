## Summary

This tip advocates for writing streamlined tests that minimize their footprint while ensuring maximum code coverage. The key is to actively verify test coverage during test runs, allowing you to reduce the size of new tests significantly (40-60%) and improve CI times. By focusing on essential coverage, you can maintain a fast shipping pace without sacrificing reliability or sleep.
