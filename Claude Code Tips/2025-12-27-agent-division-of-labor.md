> I run my home server with two agents. One for server infra and one for app/tool developments. The main md file makes the division of labor very clear. No agent does the work of another. So much so that if I ask the infra agent for app-related tasks, it’d apologize and delegate it

## Summary

This tip describes a multi-agent workflow for managing a home server by using separate agents for infrastructure and application development. The core idea is strict division of labor enforced through a central Markdown file, ensuring agents only handle tasks within their defined scope. This allows for specialization and avoids task overlap, as exemplified by the infra agent's willingness to delegate app-related requests.
