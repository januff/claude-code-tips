## Summary

This Claude Code tip emphasizes the importance of clear communication in collaborative software development by advocating for writing commit messages in English at a B2 level. This ensures that all team members, regardless of native language, can easily understand the changes being made, fostering better collaboration and reducing ambiguity. No specific commands or tools are demonstrated, but the focus is on adopting a clear and universally understandable communication style within a team's workflow.
