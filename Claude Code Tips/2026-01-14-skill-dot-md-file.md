## Summary

This tip highlights the power of Claude Code skills for automating repetitive tasks in agent workflows. Before generating a skill, it recommends providing Claude with a best practices guide (linked in the tweet) to improve the skill's quality. The core idea is to identify tasks you repeat across projects (like generating social media link previews or README files) and encapsulate them into reusable skills, potentially using additional reference files for improved token efficiency.

> @doodlestein Thanks. I have been struggling to understand what skills are, and are good for. This unlocks it a bit (together with your other tweet about `xf`). Across projects seems to be the key?

> @doodlestein This is the move. Skills get dramatically better when you feed the agent a style guide + examples first, otherwise you end up with “generic https://t.co/kttQzQXMGo” that nobody reuses.

> @BooniXBT It does a lot of stuff, but the main thing is automating this process I described. It looks at your agent session history and looks for repeatable processes that could be usefully turned into skills. And it’s a system for managing and searching and sharing those skills.

> @doodlestein Need to add better cm integration for harmful/hurtful, success/fail, agent bc validation instead of blindly creating skills yeah? Maybe im missing that but wouldn’t want a bunch of random or outdated skills

> This right here. 
> Trying to get others to use Claude more often at work so will be creating skill dot md files to help the engineers. Plan is to centralize them so that they can apply the same solutions consistently for those repeatable type of actions or events. 
> 
> A couple that I’ve made.
> Code Review Skill (based on our standards + specific library versions and yaml versions) 
> Security Skill 
> Dot NET Upgrade Skill + agent script so you can just provide a text file of repo links and it’ll clone and apply the skill 
> 
> Plan is to also have some app specific skills as well to handle any runbooks to say rerun a cron job or worker process.
