## Summary

This Claude code tip highlights a more effective prompt engineering technique. Instead of directly instructing Claude to solve a problem, ask it about different potential approaches first. This fosters exploration and can lead to more creative and comprehensive solutions, as Claude will outline multiple strategies rather than immediately committing to a single path.

## Keywords
