## Summary

This tip discusses the author's initial, underwhelming experience with the Cowork application, specifically focusing on its utility for non-developers using Claude. While the concept of using Claude within Chrome is appealing, the author found the practical applications of Cowork to be unclear. The core issue is a lack of immediately apparent use cases for the tool.

> 💥 Excited about Claude Cowork. The "Claude Code for non-coders". The reality is - the "Research Preview" label fits well. It's a taste of what's coming, but for people serious about starting today with a local agent, I still recommend starting with CC or another local agent.

> Haven't tried Cowork yet (no mac), but I setup OpenCode to act as a very capable personal assistant in the last month and this seems like a more readily accessible version of that.

> The real unlock comes when you give it access to a wide range of tools — mine can access my emails, calendar, Fizzy task list, personal task list, confluence, Xero, our research repositories at Minotaur, our company doc repositories, image generation APIs, Slack, our CRM, endpoints to get fund data, etc.
> 
> They're all defined in SKILL files, often with custom CLI tools build to access them.
> 
> Once you have that in place, it's very powerful as OpenCode (or Cowork) becomes the orchestration layer between many services, and you can write your SKILLs and AGENT to know about your specific circumstances.
> 
> Used that setup to do a lot my accounting on the weekend because I could say, "Go to Minotaur's Xero and give me a list of unreconcilled transactions with a table of suggested changes", and then work that through and have it apply it. For transactions that were unusual, I could get it to search my email to find relevant invoices since that integration was built.
> 
> So now I tend to approach tasks by asking, can OpenCode do this? Could it do it if I provide the right SKILL and CLI command that calls the right API? If you can extend it like that, then it can be quite a useful tool.
> 
> The tricky part is all the authentication. I was thinking about how to set this up for a friend and realised it's quite hard if you can't set up the auth / API calls for the major services you use, which a lot of non-technical people would struggle with.

> @jarrodwatts I’ve been using Claude Code in VS as a marketer for the last 6 months for things like updating hundreds of UTM links with a new UTM taxonomy, filing podcast scripts into the right doc format and naming structure. Can now do this in Cowork. Terminals are intimidating for non-tech.

> When you open Claude code in the terminal on your computer, it creates a feeling that you having unlimited power, control over your computer through this magic genie who can do anything. Especially for less technical people who couldn’t really use a terminal before, or could only use one a little bit.

> This seems like a great marketing release rather than an actual leap in capability. But directionally it feels right, the plumbing just isn't there yet for it to do real work like Claude Code does in development.
