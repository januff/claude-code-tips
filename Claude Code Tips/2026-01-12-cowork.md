## Summary

This tip discusses the author's initial, underwhelming experience with the Cowork application, specifically focusing on its utility for non-developers using Claude. While the concept of using Claude within Chrome is appealing, the author found the practical applications of Cowork to be unclear. The core issue is a lack of immediately apparent use cases for the tool.

> 💥 Excited about Claude Cowork. The "Claude Code for non-coders". The reality is - the "Research Preview" label fits well. It's a taste of what's coming, but for people serious about starting today with a local agent, I still recommend starting with CC or another local agent.

> Haven't tried Cowork yet (no mac), but I setup OpenCode to act as a very capable personal assistant in the last month and this seems like a more readily accessible version of that.
> 
> The real unlock comes when you give it access to a wide range of tools — mine can access my emails, calendar, Fizzy task list, personal task list, confluence, Xero, our research repositories at Minotaur, our company doc repositories, image generation APIs, Slack, our CRM, endpoints to get fund data, etc.
> 
> They're all defined in SKILL files, often with custom CLI tools build to access them.
> 
> Once you have that in place, it's very powerful as OpenCode (or Cowork) becomes the orchestration layer between many services, and you can write your SKILLs and AGENT to know about your specific circumstances.
> 
> Used that setup to do a lot my accounting on the weekend because I could say, "Go to Minotaur's Xero and give me a list of unreconcilled transactions with a table of suggested changes", and then work that through and have it apply it. For transactions that were unusual, I could get it to search my email to find relevant invoices since that integration was built.
> 
> So now I tend to approach tasks by asking, can OpenCode do this? Could it do it if I provide the right SKILL and CLI command that calls the right API? If you can extend it like that, then it can be quite a useful tool.
> 
> The tricky part is all the authentication. I was thinking about how to set this up for a friend and realised it's quite hard if you can't set up the auth / API calls for the major services you use, which a lot of non-technical people would struggle with.

> @jarrodwatts Yeah idk really - it’s like the Claude code extension in cursor and VS code. It’s literally a worse product than Claude code in the terminal.

> @jarrodwatts Remember what it was like to build before Claude Code? That's where every other role is today. Work is going to change for everyone and this is our first step.
