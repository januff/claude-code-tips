> The current tactics for using AI coding agents well are roughly:
> 
> 1. Give agents tools to self-verify
> 
> • MCP servers (agent-browser, playwright)
> • tests
> • tsc, linters
> 
> 2. Teach agents to build their own verification tools
> 
> Agents can write their own scripts, skills, subagents, eval frameworks, plans, and success criteria.
> 
> If you don't know what to ask, ask the agent: "what tools will you need to know you've done a good job?"
> 
> 3. Point the agent back at itself
> 
> • Turn complex workflows into reusable skills/subagents — after finishing a long session, ask the agent if there's anything you could extract into reusable skills.
> • Ask the agent to rewrite your prompts to be more clear
> • Use multiple models to evaluate each other (especially useful for evaluating plans + code review before a PR)
> • If a skill doesn't quite work, finish the task anyway, then feed the conversation back so it can improve the skill's instructions
> • If the agent asks you to do something manually, ask yourself: how do I teach the agent to answer this question on its own?
> • You can teach the agent to self-improve by writing meta-skills that update other skills/rules based on what worked (or didn't) as you close PRs.
> 
> 4. Give better context
> 
> • Attach screenshots
> • Link to docs/blog posts
> • Tell the agent to read source code for OSS dependencies
> • Link to examples of high-quality outcomes it should emulate
> 
> And if you don't know how to do anything above—ask the agent.

## Summary

This tip outlines effective strategies for leveraging AI coding agents by focusing on self-verification, improvement, and enhanced context. It emphasizes equipping agents with tools for self-assessment, teaching them to build their own verification processes, and prompting them to reflect on and refine their own workflows and prompts. Key actions include utilizing MCP servers and tests for verification, extracting reusable skills from complex workflows, and providing relevant documentation and examples for improved context and outcomes.

> @brian_lovin @mmt_lvt self-verification is the unlock most people skip. agents that can run tests, check their own output, and iterate without you hovering - that's where the real productivity multiplier lives. planning + verification &gt; prompt engineering every time.
