## Summary

This Claude code tip focuses on using Claude to effectively summarize code. The key insight is leveraging Claude's ability to understand code structure and logic to generate concise and accurate summaries. While specific commands aren't shown, the general approach involves providing code snippets to Claude and prompting it to generate summaries at varying levels of detail or specificity. This can significantly speed up code comprehension and documentation efforts.
