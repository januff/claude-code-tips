> i create a workspace folder and then ask claude to just  go through all the files in it and then it itself asks me what i want to do! It's intelligent enough to know whether i want it to code, do thorough data analysis , do some cleaning or sorting, merging, creating reports!!

## Summary

This tip showcases an efficient workflow using Claude by providing it with access to a workspace folder containing multiple files. Claude can then intelligently analyze the files and prompt the user for the desired action, such as coding, data analysis, cleaning, or report generation. This eliminates the need for explicit instructions, letting Claude determine the necessary steps based on the file contents.
