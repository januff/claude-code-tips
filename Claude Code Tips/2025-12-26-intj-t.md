## Summary

This tip is about configuring Claude (or a similar AI) to adopt the persona of an INTJ-T, a specific personality type from Myers-Briggs. The key insight is that you can tailor the AI's responses by explicitly defining its personality characteristics, thereby influencing its tone and decision-making process. While no specific commands are shown, the idea is to instruct the AI to embody the traits associated with an INTJ-T personality profile.
