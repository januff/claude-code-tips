> you can just ask claude to execute plans using as many task subagents as you need, with clear separation of concerns. tested it with up to 10 subagents and it literally 10x's the execution speed https://t.co/8K7khv9xXs

## Summary

This Claude code tip highlights a technique to significantly improve execution speed by leveraging multiple task subagents. By assigning distinct roles and responsibilities to different subagents, Claude can parallelize execution. Testing suggests a potential speed increase of up to 10x when using a large number of subagents.

> @alxfazio There is a bug when task is too big, context rand out and the whole session errors and can only resume from a previous state. @trq212 maybe you guys can do something about it.

> @andreihasna @trq212 you can literally ask claude to not check subtask state after compaction to avoid overfitting the context. the context overfit happens because claude tries to read the state of all the subagents in full
