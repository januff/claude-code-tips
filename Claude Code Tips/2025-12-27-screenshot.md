## Summary

This Claude Code tip prompts the user to identify anomalies within a screenshot they provide. The core idea is to leverage the user's own critical thinking and Claude's ability to process visual information to uncover hidden problems or unexpected aspects in an image. The prompt uses a question format asking if anything 'odd' would be found upon visual inspection.
