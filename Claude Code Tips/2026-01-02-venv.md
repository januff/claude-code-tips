## Summary

This code tip highlights a crucial step when using Claude, even the latest versions, for coding projects. It points out that you need to explicitly instruct Claude to utilize the project's virtual environment (venv).  Failing to do so can lead to dependency issues and incorrect execution, so clearly stating the project context, including the venv location, is key for optimal results.

> @AIFlow_ML The cluster isn’t allowed to id have to do a stupid way off installing it for just my user which is more complex, i install uv through pip in my venv

> @Teknium yes, opus has a sandbox model energy. understands and prefers docker to run code, at least on antigravity (donno if they have custom system instructions). I've also noticed opus using pydantic, typescripts and all types of structural abstractions and is great at organizing files

> Opus produced a logic trap yesterday that required a user to already have created a bundle before it would show the "Create Bundle" button. It had to over-write  correct code to do it. It did it again on 2 other pages at the same time. My concern is that the next version will be more powerful but still generate the same sort of errors.
