## Summary

Claude Code 2.1.0 brings several improvements to agent and skill development. Key updates include using Shift+Enter for newlines without extra setup, adding hooks directly to agents/skills frontmatter, and enhanced skill functionality like forked context, hot reload, and custom agent support via the `/` invoke command. Plus, agents now continue running even if a user denies an HTTPS request, streamlining the overall development workflow.

> @bcherny I use CC every day for 8 months. I still feel I need to enroll for a course since I don't understand most of the features like hooks/lsps/mcps(practically)/subagents management, etc, etc. I feel like I'm losing the grasp of the tool.

> @bcherny I've built out several complex workflows with skills &amp; agents, for DevOps production support, but there's a BIG problem...all the MCP tools I need start my context out at &gt;150k tokens, so I disabled them...I expected skills/agents to be able to enable them when listed in allowed
