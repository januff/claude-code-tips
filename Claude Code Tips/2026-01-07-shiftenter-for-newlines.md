## Summary

Claude Code 2.1.0 brings several improvements to agent and skill development. Key updates include using Shift+Enter for newlines without extra setup, adding hooks directly to agents/skills frontmatter, and enhanced skill functionality like forked context, hot reload, and custom agent support via the `/` invoke command. Plus, agents now continue running even if a user denies an HTTPS request, streamlining the overall development workflow.
