## Summary

This Claude Code tip advocates for using structured "protocols" instead of free-form prompts when interacting with large language models. The key insight is that constraints and predefined steps can lead to more predictable and reliable outputs. By establishing clear workflows and guidelines, users can mitigate the unpredictable nature of LLMs and achieve consistent results.
