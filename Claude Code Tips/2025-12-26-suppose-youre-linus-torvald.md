## Summary

This tip suggests prefacing your prompts to Claude with "suppose you're Linus Torvalds" to potentially improve the AI's response quality. The technique leverages role-playing to encourage Claude to adopt a specific persona with relevant expertise, potentially resulting in more informed and insightful answers. By grounding the AI in a known expert's perspective, you may elicit responses aligned with that person's knowledge and problem-solving approach.
