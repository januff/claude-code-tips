## Summary

This tip suggests preserving Claude context for team collaboration by exporting it as a Markdown file and tracking it in Git. By dumping the entire conversation context to a `.md` file, team members can easily access and understand the full history of the interaction with Claude. This allows others to pick up where you left off, ensuring continuity and reducing redundant work.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `git` · md file, context, team members
