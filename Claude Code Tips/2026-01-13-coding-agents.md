> @sawyerhood I’m kinda surprised there are 0 hooks! But maybe that’s me thinking in Opus 4, and I should just trust 4.5 to know which tool to pick and when…

> @sawyerhood In addition to a code walkthrough, I like a “code quiz” where I prompt it to ask me questions to find where my gaps in understanding are. If code gen and review are no longer bottlenecks, maybe comprehension is where we focus

> @sawyerhood Love this. #1 is real good. IndyDevDan mentioned it in Claude Output Style I think.
