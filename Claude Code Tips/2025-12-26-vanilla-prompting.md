## Summary

This Claude Code tip advocates for prioritizing native prompting techniques over relying on external tools for specific tasks. By directly prompting Claude, you gain a clearer understanding of its inherent capabilities and develop more sophisticated prompting strategies over time. This method removes the ambiguity of tool-specific functionalities and encourages deeper exploration of Claude's underlying functionality.
