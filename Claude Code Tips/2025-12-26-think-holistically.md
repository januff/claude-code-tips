## Summary

This tip suggests a problem-solving technique for Claude when it's stuck in a loop or producing undesirable outputs. The key action is to prompt Claude to "take a step back and think holistically". This encourages Claude to re-evaluate its approach, potentially breaking it out of the iterative rut. There are no specific commands, tools or settings mentioned other than that prompt.
