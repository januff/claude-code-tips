## Summary

This workflow utilizes Claude Code and Codex (as a MCP) for efficient code implementation. First, create a detailed plan using OpenSpec and refine it iteratively. Then, implement the plan with Claude, leveraging Codex to review the code and identify issues, which Claude then resolves. The process is automated by looping Claude and Codex for continuous review and correction.
