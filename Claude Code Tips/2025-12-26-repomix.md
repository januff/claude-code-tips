## Summary

This tip highlights the value of a "repomix skill" which allows developers to precisely control the token count in code packages. This fine-grained control enables the creation of more efficient and optimized packages, potentially improving performance or reducing costs. No specific commands, tools, or settings are demonstrated, but the underlying principle is the strategic crafting of code to meet specific token limits.
