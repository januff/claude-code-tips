> AI agents built into cloud apps will always be sub-par compared to state of the art agents that you can use with Obsidian.
> 
> This is because your Obsidian data is in your control, in plain text formats that are ideal for LLMs to process.
> 
> You can choose to run any of the best-in-class agents and AI tools: Claude, Gemini, OpenAI Codex, etc. You also have the choice to run local models and privacy-preserving options. Or you can use none of these and enjoy not seeing sparkly AI buttons everywhere. 
> 
> Remember that cloud-based note-taking apps are not end-to-end encrypted. This is inherently less secure, open to breaches, and allows companies to make your private thoughts part of their training set.
> 
> Obsidian is not working on adding agents because we don't have to. We'll let the AI labs focus on that. We're 4 developers and our focus is on making great editing tools for plain text Markdown files that are always in your control.

> I have started maintaining specific master context files in Obsidian that I repeatedly pass into Claude Code instead of explaining things repeatedly. I have a file like this now for every major project or area of my life that I'm working on right now. When I work on something significant or make progress I'll ask Claude Code to review the master context file and adjust based on what's happened 
> 
> I have a sub agent called cross-file-patterns that I use to find patterns across files related to something I am working on, I'll search a specific term in Obsidian, then get all the file names references using copy search results and send that to the sub agent which finds comprehensive patterns across those files

> 1. batch editing that use more complicated bash commands i wouldn't have done otherwise: adding links, editing properties, .etc;
> 2. create specific folders for current projects that im working on and load all the notes/pdfs/there for claude to read. make claude put on a critique lens; make claude role play different perspectives/backgrounds; make claude put valuable points into notes and keep iterating like this

> @jmduke Can you give examples of mass metadata editing? Are you having Claude generate Python scripts or how do you control hallucinations?
