## Summary

This tip highlights the value of using Claude's "diff mode" for safely refactoring legacy code. By leveraging diff mode, Claude can identify subtle edge cases that manual review might miss, thereby reducing the risk of introducing bugs and significantly speeding up the refactoring process. The estimated time savings is approximately 2 hours per session.
