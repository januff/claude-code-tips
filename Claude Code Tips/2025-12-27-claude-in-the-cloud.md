## Summary

This tip outlines how to set up your own personal Claude instance in the cloud for coding on the go. By installing Claude on a cheap VPS ($6/mo) and accessing it via SSH using Termius on your iPhone, you can bypass restrictive "vibe coding" apps. This allows for full coding capabilities like pushing, deploying, and building agents from your mobile device.
