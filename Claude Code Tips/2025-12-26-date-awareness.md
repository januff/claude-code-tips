## Summary

This Claude Code tip highlights a method for improving accuracy when asking Claude to research or consult documentation. By explicitly instructing Claude within a Claude.md file to check the current date before proceeding, you can prevent it from searching for outdated information from the past. This ensures that Claude uses the most relevant and up-to-date resources in its responses.
