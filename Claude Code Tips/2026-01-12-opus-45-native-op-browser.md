## Summary

This tip highlights a method to give the Claude Opus 4.5 model native browsing capabilities within the OP browser, isolating it from your regular browsing activity. By downloading the linked resource, you can enable this functionality, potentially replacing tools like Cursor. This allows Claude to access and interact with web content directly for enhanced performance and task completion.

> What is it?
> It's a dedicated Claude Code plugin for automatic memory capture, AI compression (using Claude's own agent-sdk), semantic search, and context injection across sessions — solving the common pain point of Claude "forgetting" everything when a session restarts.
> 
> If you're into Claude Code development, this repo's popularity reflects how much devs value fixing the "goldfish memory" issue.

> @mert If you use Antigravity it drives a dedicated chrome instance without interfering with browsing. It’s a pretty good experience and you can use Opus and Gemini Pro. Worth checking out.

> This is the "moment of realization" that every developer seems to be having this week. You are likely talking about the Claude Code CLI combined with the "Use with Chrome" integration (or the dev-browser skill).

> The reason this "kills Cursor" for you is that you just realized Cursor is blind.
