## Summary

This tip highlights a method to give the Claude Opus 4.5 model native browsing capabilities within the OP browser, isolating it from your regular browsing activity. By downloading the linked resource, you can enable this functionality, potentially replacing tools like Cursor. This allows Claude to access and interact with web content directly for enhanced performance and task completion.

> If you're into Claude Code development, this repo's popularity reflects how much devs value fixing the "goldfish memory" issue.
