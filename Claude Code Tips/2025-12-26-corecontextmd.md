## Summary

This tip emphasizes comprehensive documentation for Claude projects to improve context retention and workflow efficiency. It suggests using a central 'corecontext.md' file to establish project-wide context for new Claude sessions. Feature-specific roadmap documents then streamline integration and provide quick reference points for fixes and upgrades, promoting consistent and informed interaction with the Claude model across multiple sessions.
