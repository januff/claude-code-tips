## Summary

This Claude Code tip introduces a major update to its workflow, incorporating 13 new slash commands inspired by @bcherny's approach. The update adds commands for inner-loop development (like `/project-starter:commit-push-pr`) and verification (including `/project-starter:verify-changes` which leverages multi-agent adversarial review). It also includes updated templates, README, and verb-based skill naming conventions, expanding the system to 7 agents, 17 commands, 6 skills, and 8 hooks.

> I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. Lots of people have asked how I use Claude Code, so I wanted to show off my setup a bit.
> 
> My setup might be surprisingly vanilla! Claude Code works great out of the box, so I personally don't customize it much. There is no one correct way to use Claude Code: we intentionally build it in a way that you can use it, customize it, and hack it however you like. Each person on the Claude Code team uses it very differently.
