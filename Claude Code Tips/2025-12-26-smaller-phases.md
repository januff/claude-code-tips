## Summary

This tip advocates for breaking down app development or project execution into smaller, manageable phases instead of attempting a single, all-encompassing effort. By working in smaller chunks, users can achieve greater success through iterative progress and easier troubleshooting. The focus is on a phased approach to maximize efficiency and reduce overwhelm in project development.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `smaller-phases` · chunking, iterative-development, incremental-work, one-shotting
