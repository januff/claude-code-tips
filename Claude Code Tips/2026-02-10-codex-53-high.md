> I use this CONSTANTLY. It's almost the only thing besides vanilla agents I use regularly. And it's so simple, it's just a prompt! Run it before committing. Run it when you feel like things are growing hairy.

## Summary

This tip highlights the use of a simple prompt, likely involving a code review or linting process, to maintain code quality. The suggested workflow involves running this prompt before committing code or when the codebase becomes complex. By using the Codex-5.3-high model, the user can effectively identify and address potential issues, ensuring cleaner and more maintainable code.

> # Refactor Pass

> ## Workflow
> 
> 1. Review the changes just made and identify simplification opportunities.
> 2. Apply refactors to:
>    - Remove dead code and dead paths.
>    - Straighten logic flows.
>    - Remove excessive parameters.
>    - Remove premature optimization.
> 3. Run build/tests to verify behavior.
> 4. Identify optional abstractions or reusable patterns; only suggest them if they clearly improve clarity and keep suggestions brief.
