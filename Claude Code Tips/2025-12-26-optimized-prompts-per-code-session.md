> Not a trick, but I’ll architect an entire app, database, UI, down to the route in Claude desktop. Then I use Claude desktop to create optimized prompts per Claude code session. So I end up with 12-16 prompts that inherit and depend on the previous ones expected output to succeed.

## Summary

This tip outlines a workflow for building complete applications with Claude. The core technique involves first architecting the full application (database, UI, routes) within Claude Desktop, then creating a series of optimized, sequential prompts that build upon each other, with each prompt leveraging the output of the previous one. This iterative prompting process, facilitated by Claude Desktop, allows for granular control and ensures a cohesive application build.
