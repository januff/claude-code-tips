## Summary

This tip highlights the utility of Claude's `rewrite` command when working with filenames. By using `filename.extension .. "rewrite"`, you can instruct Claude to modify the filename directly, potentially reducing errors associated with manual renaming or transcription. This powerful pattern offers a more robust approach to file management within Claude's environment.
