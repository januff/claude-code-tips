> The state of the Internet in a nutshell: For 2.5 years, whenever I published a video on YouTube, I'd come up with a bespoke title / thumbnail that accurately described what the conversation was about. 
> 
> Then, during the summer, my view count fell. Nothing worked until I found a formula: "How to Write ________ Well." 
> 
> Always the same text. Throw an adverb in the middle, then share a quote from the interview in the thumbnail. People are 0.5% - 1% more likely to click on that title format, so the channel has exploded in growth. 
> 
> This title format is worse for my viewers and soul-deadening for me, but it's leading to so many more views that I'd be crazy not to follow it — and people are significantly more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title. 
> 
> This isn't just a story about YouTube. So much of the Internet works like this now.

## Summary

The tip highlights a common challenge for online content creators: balancing quality with algorithmic optimization. The creator found that formulaic titles like "How to Write ________ Well," combined with a quote-based thumbnail, significantly increased click-through rates despite being less descriptive and personally unfulfilling. The insight is that succumbing to clickbait-style tactics, even if detrimental to quality and the creator's well-being, can be essential for visibility and growth on platforms like YouTube.

> Are they "more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title"? or are they more likely to click on the video that youtube presents to them?

> Might it be that youtube's algo pushes your videos to more people when you use such titles? Are you able to tell?

> A thought: Maybe you can drop the adverb and just use a title something like, "How to Write Well – Fareed Zakaria Interview," keeping the same image style (headshot photo, dark background, short quote in large white font).
> 
> Did you maybe change your image style at the same time? Just wondering if it might be the image style that's capturing viewers more than the title. Or maybe momentum is building from consistency in content. 🤔
