> [!tweet] @david_perell · Feb 10, 2026
> The state of the Internet in a nutshell: For 2.5 years, whenever I published a video on YouTube, I'd come up with a bespoke title / thumbnail that accurately described what the conversation was about. 
> 
> Then, during the summer, my view count fell. Nothing worked until I found a formula: "How to Write ________ Well." 
> 
> Always the same text. Throw an adverb in the middle, then share a quote from the interview in the thumbnail. People are 0.5% - 1% more likely to click on that title format, so the channel has exploded in growth. 
> 
> This title format is worse for my viewers and soul-deadening for me, but it's leading to so many more views that I'd be crazy not to follow it — and people are significantly more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title. 
> 
> This isn't just a story about YouTube. So much of the Internet works like this now.

## Summary

The tip highlights a common challenge for online content creators: balancing quality with algorithmic optimization. The creator found that formulaic titles like "How to Write ________ Well," combined with a quote-based thumbnail, significantly increased click-through rates despite being less descriptive and personally unfulfilling. The insight is that succumbing to clickbait-style tactics, even if detrimental to quality and the creator's well-being, can be essential for visibility and growth on platforms like YouTube.

> funny. I've listened to amost every episode. Today, I checked out the fareed one and saw the title formats. I found it pretty off-putting/off-vibe for you. 
> 
> But i know it's hard to balance, and I'll still watch. But the titles feel like they're saying nothing since they are all the same

> @david_perell I have a great title that explains my video accurately then it bombs. I immediately update to my slop title and it blows up. Every. single. time. Then people complain that my title was slop after they clicked on it.

> Are they "more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title"? or are they more likely to click on the video that youtube presents to them?
> 
> I don't search for videos, I watch the ones  that appear on my feed most of the time. Which is how & when I watch your video.
> 
> Might it be that youtube's algo pushes your videos to more people when you use such titles? Are you able to tell?

> you've had great content for years (across writing, audio, video).
> 
> It's kind of annoying how formulaic content has become across formats but it's good to see you've found a way to break through.
> 
> in the end it's good as more people will see your stuff but on the whole I think the emphasis on packaging is a bad trend for social media (which isn't even social anymore atp).
