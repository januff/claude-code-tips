## Summary

This tip highlights a collaborative documentation workflow with Claude. By instructing Claude to generate and adhere to strict .MD documentation guidelines (naming, structure, content), you create context-rich files. These files then serve as shared context for both human collaborators and future Claude interactions, enabling seamless transitions between working sessions.
