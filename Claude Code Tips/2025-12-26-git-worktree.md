## Summary

This tip unlocks agent creation leveraging git worktree functionality to build custom solutions. It enables users to manage multiple branches concurrently, essentially allowing the agent to work on different features or experiments without disrupting the main codebase. By using git worktree and agent skills, you gain the power to automate complex tasks with improved version control and parallel development workflows.
