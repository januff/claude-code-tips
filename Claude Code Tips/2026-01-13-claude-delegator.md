## Summary

This tip describes a workflow for improving code quality by having Codex review code generated by Claude Code. The process involves Claude completing a task, Codex providing feedback, and Claude implementing those suggestions before another review cycle. The "claude-delegator" plugin facilitates communication between the two AI models within Claude Code, streamlining the review process.

> Introducing Claude Delegator!
> 
> A Claude Code plugin that lets you use GPT 5.2 powered subagents directly within Claude Code.
> 
> Ask GPT 5.2 (via codex) to architect your code, perform security audits, or make any other changes to your codebase.

> Here’s the agentic coding workflow I use and recommend, using Dots for agent task management [1] and Banjo [2] to harness my agents…
> 
> I start by asking the agent to create a detailed plan to do whatever needs to be done at this step. I then ask the agent to split the plan into small but detailed dots with clear titles.
> 
> Optional but helpful is to ask the OTHER agent to review the plan and incorporate suggestions, e.g. ask Claude to review Codex and vise versa. I run 2x Max/Pro subscriptions of each ($800/mo total spend) but it will work with just one agent too (see bottom of this post).
> 
> You can tell your main agent to repeat this until the other agent has no more input, e.g. “ask the oracle to confirm that the plan is detailed enough and incorporate suggestions. repeat until oracle has no more input” (see bottom of post for oracle setup).
> 
> Then you ask the agent to work with the other agent to make sure the dots are small enough and detailed enough, and to split large or complex dots into smaller ones. You can loop this too so the agents work together for a while, or to have your Claude work with its deepthink skill (see bottom of post).
> 
> I also have Banjo [2] integrated with Dots and nudging Claude Code or Codex and to continue, as long as more dots are available. This is the main harness I use for long-running agents working on something, e.g. my Lisp with dependent typing, Python decompiler, port of Cranelift JIT to Zig, etc.
> 
> Normally, Claude Code and Codex will stop after a few iterations but with Dots agents can run for hours as they create new dots for new tasks. Dots will automatically set up Claude Code hooks to make sure tasks are created. Codex has no trouble diligently creating dots for each new task, no hooks required.
> 
> I mainly run Banjo in @zeddotdev until my Neovim UI is fully debugged. The neat thing about Zed is that it will call my attention when the agent needs something.
> 
> Yes, I’m using Zig for everything since the agent turnaround is sooo much faster that with Rust and the code is smaller and tigheer!
> 
> P.S. I set up a “deep think” skill for Claude Code to deeply reason about a problem using Opus as the model. I literally just asked Claude to set up this skill for me. I also asked claude to set up an “oracle” skill where it launches Codex in the background and asks it to work on a problem or provide input. My Codex oracle skill calls Claude. Thanks to @steipete for the oracle idea!

> I do this, but I just implemented a skill (for automatic detection when prompting), and also a deliberate /codex command. I've been finding MCPs overkill for most use cases. Not to mention they blow Claude's context window from the beginning if you don't have that experimental feature enable.

> @jarrodwatts How about the other way round? Opus 4.5 just burned 35% of 5h quota review Codex 5.2’s work and came back with some garbage assessment that went to the bin!

> @indyfromoz My current thinking is codex takes it's time - it's slower but more accurate, that's why I like it for architecting &amp; reviews.

> Whereas opus is generally good for most things but needs to be put back on track some times

> @jarrodwatts I do that as well together with Gemini. I also do it the other way around have Claude give the instructions to Codex &amp; Gemini, they pair, then present the result to Claude and when there's consensus it gets merged.
