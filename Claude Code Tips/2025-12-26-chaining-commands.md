## Summary

This tip introduces the concept of command chaining, enabling you to execute multiple commands sequentially in a single line. By connecting commands using pipes (|), the output of one command becomes the input of the next.  This streamlines workflows by avoiding intermediate steps and temporary files, allowing for efficient data processing and manipulation directly within the command line.

## Keywords
