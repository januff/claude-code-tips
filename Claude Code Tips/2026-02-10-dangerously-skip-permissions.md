## Summary

The Claude Code Desktop now offers the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` command-line option, allowing for fully autonomous operation by bypassing all permission prompts. This setting streamlines workflows in trusted environments where interruptions are undesirable, enabling Claude to execute tasks without requiring user approval. While increasing efficiency, the flag should be used judiciously due to the potential risks associated with unrestricted access.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `--dangerously-skip-permissions` · permissions, autonomous, uninterrupted work, trusted environment, automation
## Classification

**NOTED** — We already use Claude Code Desktop and have explicit policies around permissions (including `/permissions` for safe auto-accept). This is a simple update on a feature we already use.
