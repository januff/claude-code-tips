## Summary

This tip introduces the concept of "adjacent LLM space," which involves manipulating and utilizing latent embeddings generated by large language models. The key insight is that these embeddings can be leveraged to perform tasks or access information beyond the immediate output of the LLM. While no specific commands or tools are mentioned, the tip highlights the potential of exploring and manipulating these internal representations to unlock new functionalities and insights.
