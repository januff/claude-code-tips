## Summary

This tip introduces Claude-Mem, a free, open-source plugin that provides persistent memory for Claude Code. It addresses the limitations of Claude's context window by recording conversations, enabling Claude to resume work and maintain context without requiring re-explanation of previous steps. This essentially gives Claude 'infinite' memory, enhancing its long-term project management capabilities.
