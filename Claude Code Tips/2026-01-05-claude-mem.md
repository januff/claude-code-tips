## Summary

This tip introduces Claude-Mem, a free, open-source plugin that provides persistent memory for Claude Code. It addresses the limitations of Claude's context window by recording conversations, enabling Claude to resume work and maintain context without requiring re-explanation of previous steps. This essentially gives Claude 'infinite' memory, enhancing its long-term project management capabilities.

> @LiorOnAI You can now have Claude use Codex as an agent!!! i created a plug in, you can install easily. From there you can ask Claude with natural language to 'Use Codex to analyze my code for bugs, when it's done take it's analysis and fix them using our agents'
