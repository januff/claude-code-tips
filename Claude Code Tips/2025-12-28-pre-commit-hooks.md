## Summary

This tip advocates using pre-commit hooks to implement fast, automated code checks before committing changes. By catching errors and enforcing style conventions early, these hooks reduce the likelihood of introducing mistakes that Claude (the AI model) would need to correct later. While no specific tools or settings are shown, the core idea is to proactively improve code quality at the commit stage.
