## Summary

This tip highlights a preference for using scripts over manual command-line procedures (MCPs) for efficiency and automation. It suggests that encapsulating complex or repetitive tasks into scripts streamlines workflows. While specific commands or tools aren't explicitly named, the core idea is to embrace scripting for improved repeatability and reduced error compared to manually entering commands.
