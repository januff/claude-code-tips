## Summary

This tip suggests using the "rubber duck" debugging technique *before* writing any code. By verbally explaining your problem and intended solution to an inanimate object (or Claude), you can clarify your thinking and identify potential issues. The key insight is that clear problem definition leads to better code, emphasizing planning and problem-solving over immediate implementation.
