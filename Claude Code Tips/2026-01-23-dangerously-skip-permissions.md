## Summary

This tip showcases an ambitious, automated startup creation workflow using Claude. It demonstrates the potential for AI to generate and deploy complete online businesses, albeit hypothetically, by automating tasks from idea generation based on Reddit trends to infrastructure setup on Hetzner, and integrating Stripe for payments. The core command provided uses Claude with the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and `--chrome` flags to execute this complex sequence, implying a high degree of automation.

> @levelsio You forgot the flag that handles the part where customers actually show up. I've got a folder of side projects with perfect landing pages and Stripe buttons that have processed exactly $0. Distribution is still the hard part, even when the build is free.
