## Summary

This tip introduces the concept of 'headless mode,' a technique for running applications or browsers without a graphical user interface. This allows you to automate tasks, run tests, or perform server-side rendering efficiently. While no specific commands are mentioned, the core idea is to execute operations in a non-interactive environment, saving resources and enabling background processing.
