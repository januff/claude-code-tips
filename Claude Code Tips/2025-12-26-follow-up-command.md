## Summary

This tip introduces a custom `/follow-up` command designed to manage large context windows in Claude. When the context window exceeds 70% capacity, this command intelligently summarizes the previous steps, relevant files, and code areas to create a self-contained prompt for the next desired action. This allows users to continue working effectively without losing context or exceeding the window limit.
