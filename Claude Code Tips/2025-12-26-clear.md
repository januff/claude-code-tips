> Start a task, copy the task’s full reasoning, run /clear, then paste that reasoning into the new session saying "hey a junior dev sent me this" so the the initial context makes the session start with full context +skeptcism, and forces a “junior dev mistakes are a problem let me

## Summary

This Claude Code tip details a creative prompt engineering technique for stress-testing and improving the reliability of Claude's responses. By clearing the chat, then re-introducing the previous task's reasoning framed as a 'junior dev' submission, you can trigger a more critical and rigorous analysis from the model. This approach uses the `/clear` command and leverages a specific prompting strategy to surface potential errors and biases.
