## Summary

This tip promotes using the Playwright browser plugin to enhance frontend development workflows. By configuring Playwright to open a browser instance and 'look at its own work,' developers can visually inspect and debug the generated frontend code in real-time. This direct feedback loop allows for immediate verification and refinement of the application's user interface and behavior, increasing development efficiency.
