## Summary

The Claude Code functionality, which allows interaction with local files, is now directly accessible within the Claude Desktop application. This eliminates the need for a separate terminal window to run Claude Code. Users can install Claude Code through the app's "Code" section and then select a local folder to begin working directly with their files within Claude.
