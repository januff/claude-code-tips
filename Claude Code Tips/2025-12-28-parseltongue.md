> I use Parseltongue dependency graph generator to exclusively query the codebase as a graph database. This significantly reduces the amount of tokens needed to look into the code. Also provides the forward dependency and backward dependency context to the LMs with much fewer

## Summary

This tip introduces using Parseltongue, a dependency graph generator, to represent your codebase as a graph database for Large Language Model (LLM) querying. The key insight is that querying this graph is more token-efficient than directly processing the code, reducing token usage. This method provides improved forward and backward dependency context to the LLM, enabling better code understanding with fewer tokens.

## Keywords
