## Summary

This tip outlines an iterative workflow for refining a Markdown document with Claude. Start by prompting Claude to create a Markdown file with a plan, then repeatedly ask 'What's next?' to build upon it. After completing the initial draft, use 'How can we improve it?' to further refine the document, repeating the cycle for continuous improvement.
