## Summary

This tip describes an efficient refactoring workflow using Claude. By providing a concise prompt, example markdown, and a target file, you can focus Claude on specific tasks. After each successful refactor, fork the conversation at the original prompt to start fresh with a new target, ensuring a clean context window and targeted focus for each refactoring iteration.
