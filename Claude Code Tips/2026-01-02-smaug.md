> @alexhillman ho, hope this one is good, getting this x bookmarks are pretty hard in folders with images/videos etc.

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @alexhillman · Fri Jan 02 15:33:26 +0000 2026

> @bitdeep_ Not fully sure how well it handles folders yet, images and videos are def on the way. Contributions welcome!

> @draparente it really is wild, and cool to see so many people trying similar things in their own way.

> @alexhillman $3.64 to process just 20 bookmarks!

> I could be wrong but I'd be surprised its the parallel part, more likely depends on what you're bookmarking.

> tweets with lots of links to big articles/etc is gonna cost more cuz it's reviewing all that stuff.

> @alexhillman This is awesome. I built something similar with a firebase backend, dashboard, and iOS client but: How do you manage the ridiculously small rate limit? Or are you handing them $200 a month.

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @alexhillman · Sat Jan 03 06:38:59 +0000 2026

> @welshofer Whose rate limit? This isn't using Twitter's api if that's what you mean. If you mean Claude it's the best $200/mo I spend.
