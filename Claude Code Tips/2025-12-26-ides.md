## Summary

This Claude Code tip promotes a minimalist coding approach, suggesting Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) aren't strictly necessary. It implies a preference for command-line coding, potentially using tools like 'CC' (likely a compiler or code execution environment) as a replacement for IDE functionalities. The underlying message is about embracing simpler workflows and potentially avoiding the overhead associated with complex IDEs.
