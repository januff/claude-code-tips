This tip highlights a strategy for improving Claude's performance in existing codebases. Before starting development, prime Claude by asking it to analyze the repository structure, code sections, or documentation. This allows Claude to build a strong understanding of the codebase's context and improve the quality of its subsequent code generation and assistance.
