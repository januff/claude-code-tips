## Summary

When debugging code with Claude, prioritize providing the raw error message or stack trace directly instead of attempting to interpret it first. Claude is often more effective at analyzing the complete error context and identifying the root cause. This approach saves time by leveraging Claude's built-in understanding of error formats, rather than relying on potentially flawed human interpretations.
