## Summary

The Claude code tip focuses on the often overlooked benefit of the `/compact` command. While known for cleaning up the conversation, it also effectively resets Claude's context window, preventing potential hallucinations or inconsistencies that can arise during extended sessions. By periodically using `/compact`, users can maintain higher-quality responses in long interactions.
