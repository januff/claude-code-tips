> Upload your entire codebase to Projects so Claude actually understands your file structure and conventions instead of hallucinating imports that don't exist. Also, being super specific about what NOT to change saves way more time than vague prompts about what you want.

## Summary

This tip focuses on improving Claude's code generation and modification capabilities. By uploading your entire codebase to Claude Projects, you provide it with the necessary context to avoid errors like hallucinated imports. Additionally, being precise about what *not* to change is a more efficient prompting strategy than vague instructions on desired changes.
