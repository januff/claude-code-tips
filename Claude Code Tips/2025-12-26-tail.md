## Summary

The tip suggests creating a non-committed work log to monitor activity across multiple terminal sessions. By exporting the log's path and using `tail` in other sessions, you can observe real-time output and quickly identify errors or unexpected behavior. This approach offers a centralized and shareable view of ongoing processes without cluttering the commit history.
