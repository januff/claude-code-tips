## Summary

This tip highlights an undocumented command or setting within Claude models, referring to it as a technique to prevent generating undesirable or low-quality output, humorously labelled "Dario slop." The core insight is that by using the specific phrase "no Dario slop" in your prompt, you can potentially improve the quality or relevance of Claude's response. Without linked content or media, further specifics on its application or effectiveness aren't available, so testing may be required to understand the effect.
