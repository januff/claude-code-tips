## Summary

This tip reveals a powerful code review technique for Claude (and potentially other agents). By simply prompting Claude with "Review the overall progress and changes again carefully. Can you do better?", you can trigger a deeper, more critical self-reflection of its generated code. This simple follow-up prompt can significantly improve the quality of the final output, regardless of the specific task or environment.
