> It you know you want to handle a plan with multiple problems and you suspect you may run out of context - tell Claude directly to assign each task to a subagent and just manage them. Requires Git though.

## Summary

This tip suggests a method for handling complex plans with multiple problems when using Claude and facing potential context limits. By instructing Claude to delegate individual tasks to "sub-agents" that it manages, you can overcome context window limitations. This technique implicitly relies on an environment where Claude can manage subprocesses, like one using Git.
