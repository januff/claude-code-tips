## Summary

This Claude code tip demonstrates a prompting technique for thorough spec review. By instructing Claude to "interview" you in detail using the `AskUserQuestionTool` about a specification document, you can surface blind spots and potential issues related to technical implementation, UX/UI, tradeoffs, and concerns. The key is to prompt Claude to ask non-obvious, in-depth questions continually until the review is complete, ensuring comprehensive analysis before final spec writing.
