## Summary

This tip advocates for a radical, iterative approach to complex coding tasks using Claude Opus. It suggests exploring a feature deeply, then abandoning the code branch and re-prompting from scratch. This allows you to leverage acquired knowledge for a more efficient and targeted solution, essentially distilling your learnings into a fresh start within Claude.
