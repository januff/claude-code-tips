> Stop “vibe coding” - Start RPG coding!🏰⚔️😀

> Imagine a 4-panel interface that turns multi-agent AI dev work into a classic turn-based party quest:
> 
> Throne Room -> issue/adjust the Quest (prompt + rules + approvals)
> 
> Party Camp -> watch agents, roles, loadouts/skills, and the turn queue
> 
> War Table -> steer subquests, dependencies, assignments, progress
> 
> Scribe’s Chronicle -> timeline + evidence (tests/lint/security) + diffs + “loot” deliverables
> 
> Same workflow, way more legible and familiar. 
> The King gives the quest, the party ships the code.

> @xpasky Given Claude coded the extension to help with this the total marginal post time is ~2 minutes or something, and Twitter matters (esp to OpenAI) so I think it's a good habit to be in.

> @typebulbit I definitely DID NOT run a formal test of the two under the same conditions in terms of the underlying models there, but I did do a fair Antigravity/Gemini3Pro vs. ClaudeCode/Opus4.5.
