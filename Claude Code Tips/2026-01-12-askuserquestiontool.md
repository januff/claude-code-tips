Check the tweet and associated links for the precise technique, commands, and settings utilized, and the value it brings.

> @clairevo The Venn diagram is not a circle! This is me! "I can't imagine a Claude Max user on OSX who knows wtf to do with an agent AND ALSO would prefer a limited desktop app experience vs... terminal." But Cowork's not useful to me until the Connectors work (they broke for me too).

> My 2c: decide who this is for. If it's for non technical people DO NOT SHOW THEM CODE. abstract away all the confusing computer work and make it super friendly. Let them "peek behind the curtain" if they really want but don't make it front and center. Don't test only with Claude Max users - if they're paying $200/mo they're probably more advanced than the non-technical user you're targeting. Lots of things that could get this product where it ought to be.

> @clairevo Connecting calendar, docs and meeting notes appear to be quite powerful from what I’ve heard from current Google PM folks using their internal variant of this right now
