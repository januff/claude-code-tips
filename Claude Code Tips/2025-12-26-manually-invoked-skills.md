## Summary

This tip highlights the power of manually invoked skills, allowing the user to specifically choose when and how to activate them. It showcases a workflow of gathering information externally (e.g., research on a phone) and then using Claude to parse this information and integrate it into documents, leveraging skills for PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation and pseudocode generation for decomposition and building. This demonstrates a flexible approach to information integration and skill application within Claude's ecosystem.
