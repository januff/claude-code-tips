## Summary

This tip advocates for utilizing a "rewind code" approach, likely referring to a method of reverting code to a previous state or version. The key insight is the importance of easy rollback capabilities, allowing developers to quickly undo changes or experiment without fear of permanently breaking the codebase. While no specific commands are shown, the implication is to use version control systems (like Git) or IDE features that support reverting to earlier states.
