## Summary

This tip proposes a hackathon centered around building "Agentic Interfaces" that facilitate seamless interaction between users and Claude Code, particularly in a cloud-based sandbox environment. The key insight is that a well-designed interface should allow both direct user input and autonomous Claude Code actions, triggered by integrations, schedules, or user commands. The goal is to create a platform where users and AI agents can collaborate effectively, suggesting potential for innovative no-code solutions.

> @rileybrown I don’t think it will a web interface. I think we’ll see insanely well designed desktop apps that compliment the web, but there are many reasons we’re able to accomplish so much with CLI. And with models getting smaller, local builds will be achievable by anyone with a mac

> @rileybrown Most devs are building rigid tools. The non-devs might win by accident because they're not constrained by traditional workflow thinking.
