## Summary

This tip introduces a worktree-first workflow for the Claude Desktop application, suggesting a new way to manage code changes and experiments. It implies a user can now leverage worktrees within the Claude Desktop environment. This likely allows for isolated environments for different features or bug fixes directly within the desktop application.
