> I tend to cicle between mini-steps. Huge improvement after just defining changes for a fraction of the project ( eg v0.1 -> v0.9) , alongside docs and naming convention, is more precise.

## Summary

This Claude code tip advocates for an iterative development approach focused on making substantial progress in small, well-defined increments. By concentrating on specific changes within a limited scope (e.g., version milestones) and simultaneously addressing documentation and naming conventions, developers can achieve greater precision and impactful improvements. The key insight is that targeted, incremental changes, paired with good development practices, yield more effective results than attempting large-scale transformations all at once.

## Keywords
