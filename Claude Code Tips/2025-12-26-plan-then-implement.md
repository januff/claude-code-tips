## Summary

This tip highlights the importance of separating the planning and implementation phases of coding. Avoid coding directly while brainstorming or problem-solving. Defer the implementation of your ideas to a separate session, which will lead to cleaner, more focused code and prevent getting bogged down in details during planning.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `plan-then-implement` · planning, implementation, sessions, code
