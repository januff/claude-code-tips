## Summary

The Claude Delegator plugin enhances Claude Code by integrating GPT 5.2-powered subagents (accessible via Codex). This allows users to leverage GPT's capabilities, such as code architecture design and security audits, directly within their Claude Code environment. The key insight is using GPT as a powerful assistant for code-related tasks from within the Claude interface. Installation instructions are available in the linked resource.

> @_colemurray got this idea from oh my opencode as well - thought it was really cool that after a successful install i could star it right there within the terminal

> @jarrodwatts Very keen to try this out; as a newbie here, could you help me set one up for Gemini 3.0 as well? I’m thinking like how @0xSisyphus labs did it with their plugin - use Gemini flash for documentation so you can delegate different tasks based on the nature of it

> @im_benhur @0xSisyphus that's the idea, would like to expand it to other agents and hopefully for local llms too

> @jarrodwatts does all the claude harness wokr on the gpt agent?

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @jarrodwatts · 2026-01-11T03:32:57+00:00

> @Barthazian it's inside the codex harness - the plugin in simple terms is really just letting claude run "codex &lt;prompt&gt; with some pre-made system prompts &amp; guides on when it should do that

> [!reply] @realKonark · 2026-01-10T21:35:06+00:00
> @jarrodwatts Can you resume codex agents from the MCP now? Last I checked you couldn’t

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @jarrodwatts · 2026-01-10T21:42:52+00:00

> @realKonark There is meant to be a codex-reply feature to continue a thread but i (claude) couldn't figure out how to make it work for v1, so currently its a fresh thread every delegation
