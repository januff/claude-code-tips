## Summary

The Claude Delegator plugin allows you to leverage GPT 5.2's code generation and analysis capabilities directly within Claude Code. By delegating tasks to GPT-powered subagents, you can get AI-driven recommendations for code architecture, security audits, and other code modifications. The key action demonstrated is using Claude Code to request technical advice, such as rating limiting strategies, from a GPT Architect.

• Delegating to Architect: Simple caching strategy recommendation for demo

• Read(prompts/architect.md)
   Read 79 lines

• GPT Architect recommends: Use Express middleware with Redis-backed rate limiting (per-IP
+ per-token). Scales to multiple instances, ~20 req/s burst.

Tradeoffs:

Option
Pros
Cons
Redis-backed
Multi-node safe, production-ready
Adds Redis dependency
In-memory only
Zero deps, fastest to ship
Breaks with scaling
Edge/CDN
Best for DDoS
Less auth-aware

> @jarrodwatts Very keen to try this out; as a newbie here, could you help me set one up for Gemini 3.0 as well? I’m thinking like how @0xSisyphus labs did it with their plugin - use Gemini flash for documentation so you can delegate different tasks based on the nature of it

> @im_benhur @0xSisyphus that's the idea, would like to expand it to other agents and hopefully for local llms too

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @jarrodwatts · 2026-01-11T03:32:57+00:00

> @Barthazian it's inside the codex harness - the plugin in simple terms is really just letting claude run "codex &lt;prompt&gt; with some pre-made system prompts &amp; guides on when it should do that

> [!reply] @realKonark · 2026-01-10T21:35:06+00:00
> @jarrodwatts Can you resume codex agents from the MCP now? Last I checked you couldn’t

> [!tip]+ :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: @jarrodwatts · 2026-01-10T21:42:52+00:00

> @realKonark There is meant to be a codex-reply feature to continue a thread but i (claude) couldn't figure out how to make it work for v1, so currently its a fresh thread every delegation
