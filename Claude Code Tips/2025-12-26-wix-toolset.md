## Summary

This tip suggests creating WiX Toolset installers manually. Instead of relying on automated tools, the user opts for a hands-on approach to building their installation packages. This likely allows for finer-grained control over the installation process and package contents. Though no specific commands or settings are shown, this approach grants more customization.
