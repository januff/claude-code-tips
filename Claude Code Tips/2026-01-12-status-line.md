## Summary

This tip describes how to add a minimalist status line to the Claude Code IDE. The status line provides a quick overview of key information like current working directory, git branch, diff count, selected model, session time, context, and token usage. By adding this customized status line, users can monitor important development details at a glance, improving workflow efficiency.

> @nummanali This is clean. Status lines like this reduce the “where am I / what did it change” anxiety, so you review faster and trust the loop more. Diff count + context left are the two I’d never ship without.
