## Summary

This Claude Code tip introduces Agent Skills for Remotion, enabling video creation directly from code prompts. The key action is adding the Remotion-specific skills package using the command `npx skills add remotion-dev/skills`. This allows you to generate animations and videos procedurally by leveraging AI to interpret your prompts within the Remotion framework, simplifying video creation.
