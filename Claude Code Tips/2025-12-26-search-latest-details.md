## Summary

This tip focuses on manipulating Claude's understanding of the current date for search queries. By explicitly stating a later date (e.g., Nov 2025) in your user memories, you can prompt Claude to prioritize more recent, albeit possibly extrapolated, information when searching, even though its knowledge cutoff is earlier. This is particularly useful when developing AI apps needing more up-to-date results than the model's training data provides.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `search latest details` · user memories, Nov 2025, knowledge cutoff, ai apps, claude model, latest data
