> @bprintco Or install https://t.co/zBkSQeSmWy and build the Ralph workflows and loops from your browser on your machine. Start them and manage them from the browser. Or have Claude code set them up for you using the MCP it installs. Just ask Claude “setup Ralphx job” and let it do it with u

> @bprintco If you have been around the block with LLM's for a few months and then someone hands you this... It is game over for normal devs. I was proficiently getting good code before, but now I have a consistent 30 person dev team. Pass it architecture it hands back a working app.

> @bprintco But it’s still pure vibing. And that will get better over time - as engineers have been able to pick up Claude code extremely quickly we can pick that up as well. The problem is solid architecture needs solid human agency. Curious how Ralph fixes that part? Same dilemma at scale.

> @bprintco Fine if you want to run only one session at a time in a repo.  Otherwise you need to set up multiple copies of your repo. But if you can manage 3+ independent heads or fronts of dev on one branch you can get very high velocity with CC alone

> @bprintco Ralph is good, but not magical. I did an experiment and let agents running for day and a half to build an app. At first glance it looked like working but it was full of major bugs. I spent 2 days trying to fix it (again with agents).
