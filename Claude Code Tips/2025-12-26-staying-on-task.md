## Summary

This tip focuses on effectively using Claude for complex tasks that require multiple debugging cycles. The key is to persist with the same approach, even when Claude seems to be faltering or taking suboptimal routes. By guiding Claude to stay on task, even when it appears to 'flake out', you can ultimately achieve the desired outcome after repeated attempts.
