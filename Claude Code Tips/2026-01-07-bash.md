Claude Code v2.1.1 introduces the "Bash" subagent, a specialized tool for executing shell commands. This new subagent enables complex, multi-step bash operations to be offloaded to a separate context window. This prevents context pollution in the main Claude thread and can improve performance and reliability for tasks involving command-line interactions.
