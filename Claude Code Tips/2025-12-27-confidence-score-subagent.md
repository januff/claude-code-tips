## Summary

This Claude code tip demonstrates improving response quality by requesting a confidence score (1-10) along with the answer.  This forces the model to assess its own certainty, and if uncertain, the prompt suggests using a sub-agent to investigate and resolve ambiguities.  By explicitly prompting for a confidence score and ambiguity handling, you encourage more reliable and thoughtful responses.
