## Summary

This Claude code tip explores using "nano banana" with a KV cache to create a persistent visual memory, significantly enhancing the model's capabilities. The technique demonstrates high-bandwidth content support across models, enabling a continuous visual narrative and cross-model communication (Claude prompts, Gemini renders). The KV cache functions as a persistent, folder-based memory system, enabling sequential image generation and resonant interactions between models.

Before Brain, I was on the Sibyl team doing large-scale machine learning. Earlier in my career, I worked on low-level performance engineering for Google’s core servers (including a memory allocator that is part of nearly every Google server call).

And I can be honest with myself: I didn’t work on truly novel insights until I moved into neural network research, and even then it was standing on the shoulders of giants.
