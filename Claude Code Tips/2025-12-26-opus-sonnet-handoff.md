## Summary

This Claude Code tip demonstrates a workflow where Opus first generates a plan file, likely for a complex task. After Opus creates the plan, the process is halted, and Sonnet takes over to execute that pre-defined plan. This allows for potentially separating planning and execution, leveraging the strengths of each model or managing resource allocation more effectively.
