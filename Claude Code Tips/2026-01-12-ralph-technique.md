## Summary

This tip recommends using the 'Ralph technique,' likely a method for improving AI agent performance, by porting a cursor example from an existing repository. Instead of using the official Anthropic Ralph plugin, the advice is to instruct your AI agent (Claude, Codex, Droid, or similar) to adapt the cursor port to your desired system, potentially yielding superior results. This bypasses reliance on the built-in plugin for potentially more tailored optimization.

> @iannuttall The Ralph technique works best with tight constraints. On that cursor port repo, I'd start with a 5-file sandbox, require tests to pass, then widen scope. Skipping the Anthropic Ralph plugin makes sense. https://t.co/nh1gUhgm5p

> @iannuttall Ralph is really about bounding the agent’s context and preventing recursive self-correction loops

> @iannuttall Finally a clear breakdown. The Ralph technique is a game changer for agent workflows. Already implementing this approach for our team's Claude integration.

> @iannuttall Specific knowledge accrues leverage. Focus on fundamentals and the rest will fall into place. This Claude Code example unlocks valuable tools, but the true power is in one's own understanding and application. Seek wisdom, not just code.
