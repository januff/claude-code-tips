## Summary

This tip recommends using the 'Ralph technique,' likely a method for improving AI agent performance, by porting a cursor example from an existing repository. Instead of using the official Anthropic Ralph plugin, the advice is to instruct your AI agent (Claude, Codex, Droid, or similar) to adapt the cursor port to your desired system, potentially yielding superior results. This bypasses reliance on the built-in plugin for potentially more tailored optimization.

> @iannuttall I built /ralph-project and I can one shot an entire project with multiple phases, but it requires a deep planning session and to scaffold the directory and technical designs up front.

> @iannuttall Exactly. I don't use the Ralph plugin itself, but added a plugin to create the external loop https://t.co/VyIQ0u36W4

> @iannuttall The Ralph technique works best with tight constraints. On that cursor port repo, I'd start with a 5-file sandbox, require tests to pass, then widen scope. Skipping the Anthropic Ralph plugin makes sense. https://t.co/nh1gUhgm5p
