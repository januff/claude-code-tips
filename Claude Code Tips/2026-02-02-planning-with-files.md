## Summary

This tip highlights the "Planning with files" Claude Code skill, enabling more effective project management by having Claude create and persistently reference markdown files throughout the entire process.  Users can install the skill using `npx skills add https://t.co/lyKJdFEJEc --skill planning-with-files` and then simply mention "Plan with files" in their prompts to trigger its usage.

> @anthonyriera Does it clean-up these files once it's done, or are they left behind?  If I roll this out to a team, I'm worried about these files ending up in source control unnecessarily.

> @anthonyriera Can confirm. Claude drifts way less with a file to reference. Been doing the same — spec first, then execute. Token cost pays for itself when you don't have to redo the feature.
