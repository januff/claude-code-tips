## Summary

The Claude Code integration in Slack now features a 'Plan Mode' for handling complex tasks. Before executing, Claude will engage in a dialogue to clarify requirements and present a detailed implementation plan for user approval. This ensures better task alignment and reduces potential errors by promoting a collaborative workflow.
