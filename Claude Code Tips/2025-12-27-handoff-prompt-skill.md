## Summary

This tip outlines a structured approach to project setup using Claude, focusing on establishing coding standards, efficient handoffs, and comprehensive documentation. It leverages a `Claude.md` file to define standards and promotes creating end-to-end project documentation that is then transformed into actionable prompts and integration contracts, facilitating contextual builds and rapid development. The emphasis is on clear standards and actionable documentation to streamline workflows.
