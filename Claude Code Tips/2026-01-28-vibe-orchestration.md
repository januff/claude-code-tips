> tonight i did something wild

> and it worked
> 
> here's exactly what happened:
> 
> ive been seeing @AlexFinn's tweets about his clawdbot "henry" — an ai that builds apps while he sleeps, sends morning briefs, and ships code 24/7
> 
> instead of watching the 35 min @gregisenberg interview myself, i told my clawdbot:
> 
> "go find alex finn's exact workflow and then copy that"
> 
> within 20 minutes my ai:
> 
> • searched google and x for alex's posts
> • found the podcast "clawdbot clearly explained"
> • extracted the key setup: morning briefs, overnight builds, mission control task board
> • identified the proactivity prompts
> • updated its own system files
> • built itself a jarvis-style visual interface
> • set up email + calendar integration (i just authorized oauth)
> 
> the result? i now have an ai employee that:
> 
> → sends me morning briefs with email + calendar summary
> → builds one small improvement every night while i sleep
> → tracks its own tasks in a "mission control" board
> → creates prs for review (never commits directly)
> → has safety rails: won't delete files, won't send emails without approval
> 
> the craziest part?
> 
> i gave it ONE instruction: "go research how alex finn set up his clawdbot and do that"

## Summary

This tip showcases a workflow for turning an AI assistant (Clawdbot or Moltbot) into a proactive employee by giving it a single instruction: learn from successful implementations like Alex Finn's Clawdbot.  By granting the AI broad autonomy and a mandate to improve workflows nightly, the user achieved automated morning briefs, overnight improvements, and a self-managed task board.  The core instructions involved granting the AI a "proactivity mandate" and instructing it to build something small and helpful every night, leveraging tools like Google Search and X to learn and improve.

> @RohunJauhar @AlexFinn How do I avoid rate limits. I’m willing to pay anything. I literally can’t do a single thing and ive tried switching my model from Claude to OpenAI, resetting the session, summarizing context. Clawdbot is just unusable. I’m running on AWS ec2

> @RohunJauhar @AlexFinn That's cool but from what I've seen, the improvements it suggests are surface level. Not much different from asking my claude account that.
