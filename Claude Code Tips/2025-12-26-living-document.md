This tip suggests creating detailed Markdown (.MD) mandate files to guide and document multi-session Claude workflows. The key insight is to use these files as "living documents" to ensure consistent and precise execution of tasks across multiple interactions with Claude. By establishing a clear and persistent mandate, users can better achieve their desired outcomes.
