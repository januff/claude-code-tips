> Use MCP with Playwright and connect Claude directly to my website. Put it in a feedback loop where it can evaluate its own behavior, identify bugs and issues, and fix them, without me explaining every step of the process in detail.

## Summary

This tip explores using MCP (presumably Model Control Plane) and Playwright to integrate Claude AI directly with a website, establishing a self-improving feedback loop.  The key insight is to enable Claude to autonomously evaluate its own performance, identify bugs, and fix them without explicit instructions, fostering continuous improvement. This approach leverages the power of AI for automated debugging and website maintenance.
