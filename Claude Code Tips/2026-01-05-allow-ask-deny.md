> Claude Code has 3 permission tiers and most people use zero of them:

> "allow" - Auto-approve the routine stuff
> "ask" - Confirm the risky stuff
> "deny" - Block the dangerous stuff

## Summary

This tip introduces Claude Code's permission tiers to streamline workflows by automating approvals. It suggests utilizing "allow", "ask", and "deny" to pre-configure responses for common code execution prompts. For example, configuring "allow" for routine actions like "npm test" can eliminate interruptions and improve developer flow.

> @adocomplete @hayesdev_ This is basically least-privilege for agents. Pre-approve deterministic, idempotent ops; gate state-changing actions; hard-block irreversible ones. You cut cognitive interrupts and reduce blast radius, Exactly how human + agent workflows should be designed.

> @adocomplete . @adocomplete hey, does this solve the problem where Claude keeps asking can it edit the file? I was talking to it in plan mode and had given a task to make skills based on the planned project so I can setup orchestration, for each skill it asks me can it create, even when I set

> @YashasGunderia Yes this can help. For editing files you can also hit shift+tab in claude code to move into auto-edit mode, which will not ask for confirmation on editing files.
