## Summary

This tip shares a quick way to customize Claude Code without extensive reading. Instead of manually configuring settings, the user suggests leveraging the Claude Code guide agent to automatically set up customizations like slash commands and hooks. This allows for faster and easier implementation of custom features.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `claude code guide agent` · customization, slash commands, hooks, agent
## Classification

**NOTED** — We already use Claude Code and /create-skill for creating slash commands. This is a confirmation of our existing workflow, even if it's a slightly different approach (asking the code guide agent directly).
