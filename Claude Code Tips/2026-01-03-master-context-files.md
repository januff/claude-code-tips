## Summary

This tip details a workflow for leveraging Claude Code more efficiently using Obsidian. The key is to create and maintain master context files in Obsidian for each project, which are then fed into Claude Code to avoid repetitive explanations. A custom "cross-file-patterns" sub-agent helps analyze multiple files, identifying patterns based on search terms and file names copied from Obsidian.

> A few goals drove the design:
> 
> First, I want to monitor how and where I’m spending my time. I have my long-term and short-term goals loaded into the system, and the daily reflection workflow helps me check whether my day-to-day is actually moving in the right direction—and at the right velocity—versus getting stuck in small tactical things.
> 
> Second, I want the system to help me develop personally. I’ve reviewed my performance feedback and built a mental model file that defines my blind spots and relative weaknesses. For example, I’m highly indexed on bias for action, so I need to ensure I’m not evaluating all people and situations through that lens. The reflection workflow references this so I’m regularly checking myself.
> 
> Third, I want more substantial meetings and reviews. By prepping me ahead of calls and 1:1s with the latest context—recent notes, open threads, coaching history—I can skip the “getting caught up” phase and focus on strategic or development-related discussion.
> 
> Fourth, I want continuity across time horizons. Daily reflections roll up to weekly reports, which roll up to monthly and annual synthesis. Patterns that are invisible day-to-day become obvious over weeks and months. Which programs are consuming disproportionate time? What tactical fires keep recurring? Hard to see in the moment, easier in aggregate.
> 
> Finally, I want to capture institutional knowledge. Meeting notes, decisions, coaching conversations—all tagged and linked to hub pages for each person and program. Six months from now when I need to remember why something was decided, it’s there.
> 
> The goal isn’t really to save time on small things, though that happens. It’s to make better, more comprehensive decisions and ensure my time goes to the highest-impact work.
