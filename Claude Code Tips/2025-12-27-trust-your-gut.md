## Summary

This Claude Code tip advocates for trusting your intuition during the coding process. While not a specific technique or command, the insight encourages developers to leverage their experience and pattern recognition to guide problem-solving. The value lies in recognizing that sometimes a hunch, based on past knowledge, can lead to faster and more effective solutions, even without immediate concrete proof.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `trust your gut` · intuition, decision-making, heuristics
