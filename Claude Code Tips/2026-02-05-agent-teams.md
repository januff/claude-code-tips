## Summary

Claude Code introduces agent teams, allowing a lead agent to delegate tasks to multiple parallel-working agents. This unlocks faster research, debugging, and building through collaborative work. To enable this feature, users need to activate agent teams within their settings.json file.

## Keywords

**Primary:** `agent teams` · agent-swarms, parallel processing, lead agent, teammates, settings.json
## Classification

**ACT_NOW** — We actively delegate tasks to Claude Code but not as "agent teams" working in parallel. This feature could significantly change our execution workflows by allowing for parallel research, debugging, and building.
