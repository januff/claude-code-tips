## Summary

This tip focuses on improving Claude's problem-solving efficiency by introducing alternative stopping points. Rather than endlessly iterating on failing solutions, prompt Claude to either explicitly ask for guidance or to pause and re-plan based on new information. This prevents wasted computation and ensures Claude remains responsive to user direction when facing roadblocks.
