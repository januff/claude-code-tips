## Summary

Claude Code can now control your Chrome browser directly, leveraging your existing login sessions to automate web-based tasks without API keys or OAuth. This feature, enabled by running `claude --chrome`, allows for workflows like scraping data, updating spreadsheets, triaging email, and even reproducing user steps for debugging. Claude pauses for human intervention on captchas or logins and then continues, offering a unique pair programming-like experience.

> @dabit3 The 'watch me do this once, then repeat 50 times' pattern is the killer feature here. We use it for testing user flows across different account states. Much faster than writing Playwright scripts for one-off automation tasks.
