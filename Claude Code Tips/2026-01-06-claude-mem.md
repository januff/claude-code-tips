## Summary

This tip introduces Claude-Mem, an open-source plugin that enables persistent memory across Claude sessions, effectively giving it 'infinite memory'. By drastically reducing token usage and increasing tool call capacity, it overcomes context window limitations. Using Claude-Mem can significantly improve the efficiency and scope of your interactions with Claude.

> [!reply] @techificial · Tue Jan 06 11:32:32 +0000 2026
> @simplifyinAI Memory is the real upgrade here, not fancy prompts most people often fall for, @simplifyinAI. When AI remembers what you were working on, you don’t have to keep explaining things again and again. That makes it feel less like a chatbot and more like someone actually helping you

> @simplifyinAI @dr_cintas This is the workaround until plugins catch on: keep a running "context doc" in Google Docs with brand voice, past wins, and client quirks. Paste it at the start of each session with "Use this as background."

> @simplifyinAI Hi @simplifyinAI, I’m seeing too many 'unique' implementations for the same AI memory problems. I’m gathering serious teams to stop reinventing the wheel and build a shared, interoperable architecture. Let’s talk consolidation.

> @simplifyinAI This type of memory is only useful in chatbots like https://t.co/pVaCfN1FR7.
