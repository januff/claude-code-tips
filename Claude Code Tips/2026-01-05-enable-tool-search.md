## Summary

This Claude Code tip reveals that setting the environment variable `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` to `true` resolves an unspecified issue. It suggests enabling the tool search functionality within Claude, likely allowing the model to leverage external tools for improved performance. The tip centers on a simple environment configuration update to enhance Claude's capabilities. This configuration enables access to the agentic tooling search which might provide Claude with additional information or skills.
