## Summary

This tip leverages Claude Code and a custom skill to remove telltale signs of AI-generated writing from text. By instructing Claude to analyze Wikipedia's list of AI writing indicators, the linked "Humanizer" skill modifies text to avoid these patterns, making it sound more natural. Users can use this skill to make their LLM-generated content less obviously AI-written.
