## Summary

This tip demonstrates a workflow for logging and summarizing Claude sessions to improve collaboration and maintain context. The key action is using Claude to access and summarize information from local log files, enabling real-time updates in both Obsidian and Claude's memory. The workflow involves managing sessions with a `Claude.md` file, organizing logs by date within the 'DEF Master Vault' application, and potentially using hooks for automation.

> @DiamondEyesFox @alexalbert__ Love the idea of doing it like this. I’ve been having my agent create an html to track everything, but obsidian would be way better. Did you used the obsidian mcp server to create the skill?

> @DiamondEyesFox @alexalbert__ Does Obsidian use embedding? How do you search for historic references? Or do you only rely on keywords?

>  "Great question from Viktor! Here's the layered answer for your setup:
> 
>   How Claude searches your vault:
> 
>   1. Keyword search (primary) - Grep/Glob through files. Fast, exact matches. Works great for finding specific sessions, commands, file paths.
> 
>   2.  Structured organization - The YYYY/MM-Month/DD/ folder structure + session logs mean I can navigate temporally ("what did we do yesterday?") without needing search at all.

>   Draft reply for Viktor:
> 
>   Three layers actually:
>   1. Keyword search via grep/glob (fast, exact)
>   2.  Temporal navigation via folder structure (YYYY/MM/DD)
> 
>   Most context restoration is actually #2 - Claude reads today's session log first, then yesterday's if needed. Embeddings are more for "did we solve this before?" type queries."
