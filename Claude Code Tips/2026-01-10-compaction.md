## Summary

This Claude Code tip highlights a strategy to effectively manage compaction issues by starting with 'Plan Mode' and requesting a 'Comprehensive To Do list'. This ensures that your plans and To-Dos persist even after compaction, leading to efficient code generation as demonstrated by a reported runtime of approximately 53 minutes. This method allows for well-structured code output due to the prior comprehensive planning stage.

> @nummanali Wow, excellent. That de-prioritizes the rest of experimental methods for me quite a bit. This and the Anthropic shipped Ralph skill should be enough to do a lot already.

> @nummanali Yes. I've run 153 sessions in the same window for over 36 hours with auto-compaction, and several times it picked up on the to-dos from before compaction and completed the rest of the implementation in a new session without breaking a sweat.

> @nummanali I totally agree. The current Plan mode is becoming more like the SDD approach, and Claude is properly referring to this plan document from the Nov. version.
