## Summary

This tip outlines a powerful workflow for leveraging Claude to accelerate project development. By using Opus 4.5 with extended thinking and a strategic prompting sequence, you can transform Claude into a virtual co-founder. The process involves defining your project comprehensively, prompting Claude to ask clarifying questions, and then instructing it to create a master plan with a detailed knowledge base directory designed for Claude Code integration, saving significant planning time.

> 
> then when the project is done i copy and paste the doc into claude chat then prompt it to summarise the key insights in the document

> AI won't always be able to catch mistakes in the moment, but once the project is done its really good at analyzing the process that led to the outcome

> The part most people miss: that "master plan with knowledge base directories" IS your https://t.co/4yRR31zV21 file. Claude Code reads it automatically at session start.

> So it's not a one-time planning session — it becomes a compounding system that gets better with every session you run.

> @EXM7777 The cofounder framing is solid, but if you dump everything into one Opus 4.5 chat you’ll hit context fragmentation fast once code and specs evolve. I’ve found per-scope projects (product, infra, agents) with explicit contracts between them scale way better.

> @EXM7777 IMO creating skills/files prematurely just leads to bloat/outdated info. Then it becomes a mess updating old files/fixing broken references/etc.

> Prefer to only document something (ie create a skill) after I’ve established its usefulness (repeated same process multiple times).
