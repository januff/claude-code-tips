## Summary

This tip outlines a powerful workflow for leveraging Claude to accelerate project development. By using Opus 4.5 with extended thinking and a strategic prompting sequence, you can transform Claude into a virtual co-founder. The process involves defining your project comprehensively, prompting Claude to ask clarifying questions, and then instructing it to create a master plan with a detailed knowledge base directory designed for Claude Code integration, saving significant planning time.

> @EXM7777 The cofounder framing is solid, but if you dump everything into one Opus 4.5 chat you’ll hit context fragmentation fast once code and specs evolve. I’ve found per-scope projects (product, infra, agents) with explicit contracts between them scale way better.
