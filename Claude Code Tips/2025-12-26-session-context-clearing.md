> Continually writing plans, clearing session context upon phase completion, and then moving to the next to keep it lean and without contextual bloat. That’s all I got really. Everyone else is expert level Claude management

## Summary

This tip describes a Claude workflow for managing context and avoiding overload. The core idea is to explicitly create plans, execute each phase, then clear the session context after each phase is done to maintain efficiency. By clearing context frequently, you prevent contextual bloat and improve Claude's focus on the current task.
