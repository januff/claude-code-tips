> Start a task, copy the task’s full reasoning, run /clear, then paste that reasoning into the new session saying "hey a junior dev sent me this" so the the initial context makes the session start with full context +skeptcism, and forces a “junior dev mistakes are a problem let me check this for real lol” pass on details like paths, imports, exports, and dependencies, usually produces better and more organized results.
