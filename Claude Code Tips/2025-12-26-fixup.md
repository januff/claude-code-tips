## Summary

This tip focuses on teaching Claude how to improve commit history by distinguishing between new commits and fixups. It helps Claude understand that a new commit represents a distinct, logical change, while a fixup addresses errors or minor modifications to a previous commit. By clarifying these distinctions, Claude can generate cleaner, more understandable commit histories, improving collaboration and code maintainability.
