> @dejavucoder tbh i have a very limited experience of claude code and i am learning how to efficiently use it. there are not many tutorials/guides (and some don’t go in depth from a dev’s perspective). this is a goldmine blog for beginners! thanks for writing it.

> @dejavucoder Thanks, enjoyed reading it. I started with trying Cursor and Antigravity and biggest issue was the speed so excited to try Claud with the tips you gave. Creating commands and executing in the background sounds really nice.
