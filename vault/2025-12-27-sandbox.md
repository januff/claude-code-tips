## Summary

This Claude Code tip introduces Sandbox Mode, a feature that allows you to define a secure environment for Claude to execute commands. By pre-approving commands like `npm install`, `npm test`, and `cat`, you enable Claude to work freely within defined boundaries. The demonstration shows how to use auto-allow for bash commands like `ls -la` and `git log` to manage files and view project information, offering a balance of speed and security.

> @adocomplete This is super cool. I created a Go version with built-in violation monitoring, command blocking, and support for inbound requests (for sandboxing servers). The idea is a single unifying permission config for all of your CLI coding agents. Try it out: https://t.co/YmqKeIoET4
