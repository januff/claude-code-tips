## Summary

This Claude code tip demonstrates a prompting technique for thorough spec review. By instructing Claude to "interview" you in detail using the `AskUserQuestionTool` about a specification document, you can surface blind spots and potential issues related to technical implementation, UX/UI, tradeoffs, and concerns. The key is to prompt Claude to ask non-obvious, in-depth questions continually until the review is complete, ensuring comprehensive analysis before final spec writing.

> @trq212 @spec Looks like an awesome way to do stuff. Maybe make a particular sub-agent for this and provide the sub-agent file so everybody can use it. Best would be a plugin, IMHO.

> @trq212 @spec What would be matching prompt to validate that feature is built correctly? Even after 40 questions/answers LLM can ignore everything you said, so how would we check?

> [!reply] @BrandGrowthOS · Sun Dec 28 20:17:29 +0000 2025
> @trq212 @spec Solid prompt structure. When you run this across multiple features, do the refined specs become reusable templates, or does each interview generate one-off documentation?

> @trq212 @spec I hate AskUserQuestion as Claude uses it obsessively and inappropriately - don’t use a modal to ask me questions about a document you just wrote or a lengthy output I’m supposed to read that sits *over* the output in question
