> I have started maintaining specific master context files in Obsidian that I repeatedly pass into Claude Code instead of explaining things repeatedly. I have a file like this now for every major project or area of my life that I'm working on right now. When I work on something significant or make progress I'll ask Claude Code to review the master context file and adjust based on what's happened

> I have a sub agent called cross-file-patterns that I use to find patterns across files related to something I am working on, I'll search a specific term in Obsidian, then get all the file names references using copy search results and send that to the sub agent which finds comprehensive patterns across those files

> I’ve been building a personal assistant system with Kiro AI + Obsidian and wanted to share a bit about how it works and what I’ve learned.
> 
> A few goals drove the design:
> 
> First, I want to monitor how and where I’m spending my time. I have my long-term and short-term goals loaded into the system, and the daily reflection workflow helps me check whether my day-to-day is actually moving in the right direction—and at the right velocity—versus getting stuck in small tactical things.
> 
> Second, I want the system to help me develop personally. I’ve reviewed my performance feedback and built a mental model file that defines my blind spots and relative weaknesses. For example, I’m highly indexed on bias for action, so I need to ensure I’m not evaluating all people and situations through that lens. The reflection workflow references this so I’m regularly checking myself.
> 
> Third, I want more substantial meetings and reviews. By prepping me ahead of calls and 1:1s with the latest context—recent notes, open threads, coaching history—I can skip the “getting caught up” phase and focus on strategic or development-related discussion.
> 
> Fourth, I want continuity across time horizons. Daily reflections roll up to weekly reports, which roll up to monthly and annual synthesis. Patterns that are invisible day-to-day become obvious over weeks and months. Which programs are consuming disproportionate time? What tactical fires keep recurring? Hard to see in the moment, easier in aggregate.
> 
> Finally, I want to capture institutional knowledge. Meeting notes, decisions, coaching conversations—all tagged and linked to hub pages for each person and program. Six months from now when I need to remember why something was decided, it’s there.
> 
> The goal isn’t really to save time on small things, though that happens. It’s to make better, more comprehensive decisions and ensure my time goes to the highest-impact work.
