> @hanghuang_ Gpt-pro might get rid of some extra details Claude gives, but no, I find more a second review always helps if it’s complex. Gpt 5.2 is also smart enough to tell you what’s not needed

> @noborderhuman I don’t find it too much for starting a complex task, for the pro run just run it and go do something else first lol

> @aidanjmorgan I find it helps when I tell the agent, "Keep at least the same level of detail as the plan copied to you."

> @mattlam_ I’ve wrapped a very similar process into a skill and then handing then plan over a build queue with autonomous agents to work on the whole plan.
