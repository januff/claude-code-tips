> 2026 is going to be the year of Agentic Interfaces
> 
> Ever since I started using Claude Code with Obsidian, i've been thinking about the best way to set this up on the web (in a sandbox). 
> 
> Basically... what would be the best agent interface? Designed to be used by you and Claude Code. 
> 
> Where you can directly interact with the interface, but so could claude code. You could directly interact with claude code in the chat, or it could run in the background... triggered by external integrations, or you could schedule tasks. 
> 
> I think this will be our first MAJOR hackathon. Building an Agentic interface in the cloud... with massive prizes... 
> 
> My prediction is that a vibe coder (non dev) will win, but I could be wrong... If this agent hackathon sounds interesting let me know below

> @rileybrown I don’t think it will a web interface. I think we’ll see insanely well designed desktop apps that compliment the web, but there are many reasons we’re able to accomplish so much with CLI. And with models getting smaller, local builds will be achievable by anyone with a mac

> @rileybrown The best agent interface probably looks less like a chat box and more like a multiplayer canvas where you, Claude, CRON, and webhooks all share the same stateful timeline and can attach or revoke capabilities in real time.

> @rileybrown Exactly what I’ve been searching as well and why I started to use obsidian. Still don’t like that mcp only works from desktop - skill can be a workaround here but perfect world is still a few steps away

> @rileybrown Agentic interfaces really do feel like the next evolution beyond just chatting. The idea of co-working with Claude, sometimes hands-on, sometimes running quietly in the background, just makes sense.

> @rileybrown The winning agent interface will minimize clicks and maximize intent, tight context, safe sandboxes, and fast feedback loops matter more than flashy UI.

> @rileybrown I’ve been thinking about this too. Obsidian is great, but def a note taking app and built for “second brain” community… it’s kinda weird opening an Obsidian vault in the .claude folder to see skill, agents, plugins, etc.

> An agent you can contact on any social media account, email, or phone, and it can self-register on any other social account to help you.

> Eg: Some rando has FB, IG, and X, but also has a private group on Skool. The agent has the other 3, but registers on Skool to become a PA inside the group.
