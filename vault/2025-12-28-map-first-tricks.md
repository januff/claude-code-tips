## Summary

3 underrated tricks: (1) MAP.FIRST as token saver — check MAP.md first with file:line references, eliminates 80% of search loops. (2) Target state = 0 — delete completed tasks, treat empty TODO.md as success not emptiness. (3) ASCII gates before code — visualize in PLAN phase to catch misunderstandings before burning tokens building wrong thing.
