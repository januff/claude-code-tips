> AI agents built into cloud apps will always be sub-par compared to state of the art agents that you can use with Obsidian.
> 
> This is because your Obsidian data is in your control, in plain text formats that are ideal for LLMs to process.
> 
> You can choose to run any of the best-in-class agents and AI tools: Claude, Gemini, OpenAI Codex, etc. You also have the choice to run local models and privacy-preserving options. Or you can use none of these and enjoy not seeing sparkly AI buttons everywhere. 
> 
> Remember that cloud-based note-taking apps are not end-to-end encrypted. This is inherently less secure, open to breaches, and allows companies to make your private thoughts part of their training set.
> 
> Obsidian is not working on adding agents because we don't have to. We'll let the AI labs focus on that. We're 4 developers and our focus is on making great editing tools for plain text Markdown files that are always in your control.

> I have started maintaining specific master context files in Obsidian that I repeatedly pass into Claude Code instead of explaining things repeatedly. I have a file like this now for every major project or area of my life that I'm working on right now. When I work on something significant or make progress I'll ask Claude Code to review the master context file and adjust based on what's happened 
> 
> I have a sub agent called cross-file-patterns that I use to find patterns across files related to something I am working on, I'll search a specific term in Obsidian, then get all the file names references using copy search results and send that to the sub agent which finds comprehensive patterns across those files

> 2. create specific folders for current projects that im working on and load all the notes/pdfs/there for claude to read. make claude put on a critique lens; make claude role play different perspectives/backgrounds; make claude put valuable points into notes and keep iterating like this

> @kepano Somewhat related. I use Obsidian Web Clipper to convert websites to markdown files and then upload them into Claude chats and projects. MD files use way less tokens versus having Claude fetch the websites.

> @DontFearAI Yes. LLMs are incredibly slow and wasteful for converting HTML to Markdown, compared to the rules-based approach of Defuddle (the underlying library I built for Obsidian Well Clipper)

> @kepano I migrated from Notion to Obsidian specifically for this. Because the vault is just local text files, I can point Claude Code at the directory to get cross-file insights, auto-organize folders, and batch-edit metadata. It's a game changer for maintenance
