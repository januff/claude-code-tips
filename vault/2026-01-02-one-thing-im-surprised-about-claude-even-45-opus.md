> @Teknium yes, opus has a sandbox model energy. understands and prefers docker to run code, at least on antigravity (donno if they have custom system instructions). I've also noticed opus using pydantic, typescripts and all types of structural abstractions and is great at organizing files

> Opus produced a logic trap yesterday that required a user to already have created a bundle before it would show the "Create Bundle" button. It had to over-write  correct code to do it. It did it again on 2 other pages at the same time. My concern is that the next version will be more powerful but still generate the same sort of errors.

> @Teknium This is a common issue! I've found that explicitly stating 'use the project's venv' in the prompt helps Claude stay on track. Sometimes it's just about being more specific with instructions.
