> Start a task, copy the task’s full reasoning, run /clear, then paste that reasoning into the new session saying "hey a junior dev sent me this" so the the initial context makes the session start with full context +skeptcism, and forces a “junior dev mistakes are a problem let me check this for real lol” pass on details like paths, imports, exports, and dependencies, usually produces better and more organized results.

> Whenever I want to use an API, I first gitclone the relevant library itself. Then I get agent-plan or agent-explore to create a custom research document md according to my requirements and the clone library for the API I need. Significantly reduces the hallucination that can happen for external APIs. Also APIs keep changing all the time. So often if you ask LLM's to directly use the APIs they can make mistakes. Also the depth of what they pay offers is easily uncovered when you get these agents to explore the Git clone.

> /trade I need to improve the name but it gets claude to accept a question and provide A) Options, B)Tradeoffs, C) Scores them on a scale of 1-10, D) Give a final recommendation. It also looks at it from different perspectives, by default the most "appropriate" perspective, and after it's done, it let's me pick which option to implement (select A, B, C or D, or Y to accept my recommendation) or to consider it from another perspective, e.g. a DBA, an Accessibility SME etc. (select an alternate perspective to analyze this problem from 1 for DBA, 2 for A11y SME etC)
> 
> /improve Pass in any kind of writing and optionally the perspective to review it from (I usually default to technical documentation writer) and then it does multiple iterations. Picks 4 dimensions to grade it on. Critiques those dimensions briefly, and then improves the writing from the worst dimension and then rescores it. Sometimes I ask it for 10 iterations.

> I use Parseltongue dependency graph generator to exclusively query the codebase as a graph database. This significantly reduces the amount of tokens needed to look into the code. Also provides the forward dependency and backward dependency context to the LMs with much fewer tokens. Also it increases the context of the overall pyramid understanding of the codebase for the LLMs
> 
> ClaudeCode is actually smart enough to query this dependency graph/graph database. I provide a reference file which gives it a set of ideas on how to run the API queries to this graph database and ClaudeCode actually works pretty well with it. So I never use grep or any similar code search tools with ClaudeCode
