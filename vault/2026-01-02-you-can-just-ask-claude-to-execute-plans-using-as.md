> you can just ask claude to execute plans using as many task subagents as you need, with clear separation of concerns. tested it with up to 10 subagents and it literally 10x's the execution speed https://t.co/8K7khv9xXs

> @andreihasna @trq212 you can literally ask claude to not check subtask state after compaction to avoid overfitting the context. the context overfit happens because claude tries to read the state of all the subagents in full

> Context editing:  
> It automatically clears stale tool calls and results from the context window when approaching token limits. As the agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention.
> 
> Memory tool:  
> It enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without keeping everything in context.
