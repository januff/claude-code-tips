    "text": "The state of the Internet in a nutshell: For 2.5 years, whenever I published a video on YouTube, I'd come up with a bespoke title / thumbnail that accurately described what the conversation was about. \n\nThen, during the summer, my view count fell. Nothing worked until I found a formula: \"How to Write ________ Well.\" \n\nAlways the same text. Throw an adverb in the middle, then share a quote from the interview in the thumbnail. People are 0.5% - 1% more likely to click on that title format, so the channel has exploded in growth. \n\nThis title format is worse for my viewers and soul-deadening for me, but it's leading to so many more views that I'd be crazy not to follow it — and people are significantly more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title. \n\nThis isn't just a story about YouTube. So much of the Internet works like this now.",

    "text": "The most interesting thing about Claude Code is the extensibility — small things can easily compound into bigger things you didn't plan.\n\nI started telling Claude Code to write project notes at the end of each work session: What got done, decisions made, open questions, etc.\n\nThis is a practice I've had for a long time, just a way to make it easy to pick up where I left off. \n\nIt writes the notes itself into a file so I don't even have to write it anymore which is already really nice. (I eventually turned this into a /wrap command I run at the end of every session.)\n\nAfter a few days I realized: I have project-level notes across everything I'm working on. Those could roll up into a single daily note pretty easily. So I told Claude to summarize the project workbenches into a daily log. Took about two minutes to set up.\n\nThen I started doing my weekly review for the week. I already had seven daily summaries sitting there. \n\nInstead of manually going over my calendar and task list like usual, I made a command that pulls from those and drafts the first version of my weekly review — what got done, what's stuck, what to prioritize next week. \n\nThen I realized: I also have a file with my goals and priorities, and now I have a summary of how I actually spent my week. Why am I manually eyeballing whether those line up? \n\nI told Claude to audit them — compare what I said I'd focus on against what I actually did, and flag the gaps.\n\nThe gaps then inform what I need to work on next week. If I decide to reprioritize, I can tell Claude to update my quarterly goals and weekly boals based on the new priorities.\n\nBecause it has access to my Google Calendar, it can pretty easily check whether I actually have time for what I'm planning.\n\nYou can imagine how you could build more on top of this:\n\nE.g. Send the team weekly update — make a command that takes the weekly review and reformats it for a team audience. Different tone, more context for people who aren't in my head all day. The raw material is already there.\n\nNone of these steps were planned in advance. Each was a small, obvious extension of the last primitive. \n\n- Daily note = summary of project workbenches. \n- Weekly review = summary of daily notes. \n- Goals audit = cross-reference of two files that already existed.\n\nEach piece took a few minutes to set up because the building blocks were already there. \n\nThat's the thing that's both impressive hard to convey about these CLI tools — while some single steps are impressive (e.g. the ability to one shot complex software), the more interesting and exciting thing to me is the ways they compound over time.",

Teach agents to build their own verification tools\n\nAgents can write their own scripts, skills, subagents, eval frameworks, plans, and success criteria.\n\nIf you don't know what to ask, ask the agent: \"what tools will you need to know you've done a good job?\"\n\n3. Point the agent back at itself\n\n• Turn complex workflows into reusable skills/subagents — after finishing a long session, ask the agent if there's anything you could extract into reusable skills.\n• Ask the agent to rewrite your prompts to be more clear\n• Use multiple models to evaluate each other (especially useful for evaluating plans + code review before a PR)\n• If a skill doesn't quite work, finish the task anyway, then feed the conversation back so it can improve the skill's instructions\n• If the agent asks you to do something manually, ask yourself: how do I teach the agent to answer this question on its own?\n• You can teach the agent to self-improve by writing meta-skills that update other skills/rules based on what worked (or didn't) as you close PRs.\n\n4. Give better context\n\n• Attach screenshots\n• Link to docs/blog posts\n• Tell the agent to read source code for OSS dependencies\n• Link to examples of high-quality outcomes it should emulate\n\nAnd if you don't know how to do anything above—ask the agent.",

    "text": "holy shit it fucking WORKS. \n\nSMART FORKING. My mind is genuinely blown. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND every Claude Code user implement this into their own workflows. \n\nDo you have a feature you want to implement in an existing project without re-explaining things? As we all know, the more relevant context a chat session has, the more effectively it will be able to implement your request. Why not utilize the knowledge gained from your hundreds/thousands of other Claude code sessions? Don't let that valuable context go to waste!!\n\nThis is where smart forking comes into play. Invoke the /fork-detect tool and tell it what you're wanting to do. It will then run your prompt through an embedding model, cross reference the embedding with a vectorized RAG database containing every single one of your previous chat sessions (which auto updates as you continue to have more sessions). \n\nIt will then return a list of the top 5 relevant chat sessions you've had relating to what you're wanting to do, assigning each a relevance score - ordering it from highest to lowest. You then pick which session you prefer to fork from, and it gives you the fork command to copy and paste into a new terminal. \n\nAnd boom, there you have it. Seamlessly efficient feature implementation. \n\nHappy to whip up an implementation plan & share it in a git repo if anyone is interested!",

I used to manually explain that to the agent and point it to one of my other projects as an example. But now I have this skill:\n\nhttps://t.co/JSrg76O92M\n\n2) I always need to write README files for my new projects on GitHub. I used to tell it to use another project as a model, but now it will just know to use this skill:\n\nhttps://t.co/6VeFMWU43b\n\nNote that both of those skills make use of additional reference files that are included in the same directory as the skill dot md file. \n\nThis is a good best practice for better token efficiency through progressive disclosure.\n\nBut you don’t actually need to know any of that stuff if you tell Claude to read that skills best practices guide I linked to above!\n\nSeriously, don’t sleep on skills, they’re an amazing idea and very well supported by the latest version of Claude Code.",

    "text": "My Beginner Tierlist of Agent Abstractions (for Claude):\n1. Subagents - Direct buff. Frequently very useful for preventing context rot and ad-hoc specialisation. Sorta adjacent to RLM. IMO, it's good bc as agents get smarter they very effectively allocate subagents. Bitter-lesson adjacent. Simple to use w not much variation - \"use subagents when needed\". Half as useful as much more complex setups (multi-agent) for much less complexity.\n2. Metaprompting - I made a metaprompting claude command to expand my task requests into full prompt files + scratchpad. I take 3 minutes to prompt a 20-minute task. Also generally a direct buff. You should usually read the metaprompt plan, but improves stability and sanity-checks assumptions anyway.\n3. Asking the user more at the beginning - Generally direct buff, but u have to answer questions in plan mode. A little non-transparent bc i can't tell if it's not asking bc it understands, the command is off or has no questions.\n4. \"Thinking\" prompts - Generally a buff and easy to toss in, but not-transparent and is sorta getting phased out per Boris.\n-----below are useful, but high skill floor------\n5. Long-running agents - The main thing is you have to think a bit to be able to prompt and set this up well. Basically you have to understand the shape and tradeoff of a 15 minute task before you understand the shape of a 1.5 hour or 4 hour task. Or whether to do four 15 minute tasks or one 1-hour task. And It takes some tweaking and is obv very long trial-and-error. Fundamentally tho, it's usually the same setup \"but go longer in a useful way\".\n6. Parallel multi- agent - I think this is very high-variance, and only useful on highly complex or highly well-segmented/scoped tasks or very very experienced setups. If 2 tasks take 10 minutes and you spend an arbitrary amount of time prompting or god forbid, merge changes, it's counterproductive. If u have a good scaffold for this tho, prolly very good, you just prolly won't get there with parallel multi-agent. High skill floor and skill ceiling vs the direct buffs above.\n7. Role-based multi-agent - It can work, but I am on principle bearish on this. Models just evolve too fast for hard-coded heuristics unless the arbitrage is very high. Also hard to test. I've seen people swear by Codex planner + Opus executor which probably works. Idk, maybe skill issue?\n8. Computer Use Agents - I think this is hard to do bc it plays at a very long tail of tasks. You're getting models to do something they were definitely not even meant to do a year ago. As a paradigm, very early and requires wrangling. @hud_evals will cook here, tho.\n\n(MCP/search agents I feel is more a situation-dependent tool to fetch from data sources that otherwise wouldn't exist at all. And p much all production agent scaffolds have this now. ig if you're pedantic, they're top tier bc theyre the default)",

    "text": "Just shipped adversarial-spec, a Claude Code plugin for writing better product specs.\n\nThe problem: You write a PRD or tech spec, maybe have Claude review it, and ship it. But one model reviewing a doc will miss things. It'll gloss over gaps, accept vague requirements, and let edge cases slide.\n\nThe fix: Make multiple LLMs argue about it.\n\nadversarial-spec sends your document to GPT, Gemini, Grok, or any combination of models you want. They critique it in parallel. Then Claude synthesizes the feedback, adds its own critique, and revises. This loops until every model agrees the spec is solid.\n\nWhat actually happens in practice: requirements that seemed clear get challenged. Missing error handling gets flagged. Security gaps surface. Scope creep gets caught. One model says \"what about X?\" and another says \"the API contract is incomplete\" and Claude adds \"you haven't defined what happens when Y fails.\"\n\nBy the time all models agree, your spec has survived adversarial review from multiple perspectives.\n\nFeatures:\n- Interview mode: optional deep-dive Q&A before drafting to capture requirements upfront\n- Early agreement checks: if a model agrees too fast, it gets pressed to prove it actually read the doc\n- User review period: after consensus, you can request changes or run another cycle\n- PRD to tech spec flow: finish a PRD, then continue straight into a technical spec based on it\n- Telegram integration: get notified on your phone, inject feedback from anywhere\n\nWorks with OpenAI, Google, xAI, Mistral, Groq, Deepseek. Leveraging more models results in stricter convergence.\n\nIf you're building something and writing specs anyway, this makes them better.\n\nCheck it out and let me know what you think!\n\nhttps://t.co/OrFf5HUI10",
