If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result.\n\nClaude tests every single change I land to https://t.co/pEWPQoSq5t using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.\n\nVerification looks different for each domain. It might be as simple as running a bash command, or running a test suite, or testing the app in a browser or phone simulator. Make sure to invest in making this rock-solid.\n\nhttps://t.co/m7wwQUmp1C",

Or you can use none of these and enjoy not seeing sparkly AI buttons everywhere. \n\nRemember that cloud-based note-taking apps are not end-to-end encrypted. This is inherently less secure, open to breaches, and allows companies to make your private thoughts part of their training set.\n\nObsidian is not working on adding agents because we don't have to. We'll let the AI labs focus on that. We're 4 developers and our focus is on making great editing tools for plain text Markdown files that are always in your control.",

Wrote a very detailed prompt in ChatGPT, telling it that I was going to use this prompt for Claude Code. It helped me refine the prompt by telling me to add more details where needed and creating a well-structured prompt.\n\n2. Fed this to Claude Code and it absolutely crushed it! About 10min of total runtime with me just approving a few permissions & commands.\n\n3. Then during code review, I used Cursor to make some more surgical edits to specific sections. For example, I needed the endpoint inputs and outputs to match the formats elsewhere in my codebase.\n\nOverall I was very impressed with Claude Code. The feature was implemented as I specified, and even though I had to do a bit of refinement with Cursor to get exactly what I wanted, the performance was certainly better than using Cursor alone.",

Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without keeping everything in context.\n\nAll Claude models are the best in the world for building agents, as they have been trained so well to use these features.",

        "text": "\"Should a skeleton of frontend+backend come first\"; I think you get a better result faster by creating one big comprehensive, detailed, granular plan. That's the only way to get these models to use their big brains to understand the entire system all at the same time. Once you start turning it into actual code, it gets way too big to understand.\n\nFinding the flaws and fixing them is the whole point of all the iterations and blending in the feedback from all the frontier models. If you follow the procedure I outlined using those specific models and prompts, after enough rounds, you will have an extremely good plan that will \"just work.\"\n\n---\n\n\"Before using beads, i let the agent describe the relationships between tasks into the tasks\"\n\nTo me, this is just part of the process of turning the plan into beads. The beads are in a sense a much richer structure than the plan; the beads are supposed to be totally self-contained so that you never need to refer back to the markdown plan once you've converted it into beads. \n\nBut the beads also contain the dependency structure in an explicit form (at least if you created them correctly using something like the prompt I provided). \n\n---\n\n\"Which tech stack should be used? Are there existing open source projects that does parts of this?\" \n\nI view this as all part of the \"pre-planning\" phase. Usually I already know what tech stack I want based on the type of project, but if I don't, I'll have do a deep research round with GPT Pro or Gemini3 and have them study all the libraries and make a suggestion taking my goals into account.\n\n---\n\n\"If each bead is a bit complex then I think it makes sense to document design decisions in markdown\"\n\nI disagree, the beads themselves can and should contain this markdown. You can have long descriptions/comments inside the beads, they don't need to be short bullet point type entries. \n\n---\n\n\"I do a security review pass when the high level architecture (interfaces and protocols, basic use cases) are done/known\" \n\nThis happens automatically as part of the planning process when you do it the way I described. But after the code is written, when you keep doing those rounds of checks, you can explicitly mention security as a concern and it will find any lingering problems (it generally does that as part of the review process even if you don't even use the word 'security').\n\n---\n\n\"How do you divide the tasks to your swarm of agents?\"\n\nEach agent just uses bv on its own to find the next optimal bead to work on and marks it as being in-progress and communicates about this to the other agents using Agent Mail. It's a distributed, robust system where every agent is fungible and replaceable if they crash or get amnesia. \n\n---\n\n\"Do they need individual areas of expertise for this to be efficient\"\n\nNo, every agent is fungible and a generalist. They are all using the same base model (or a combination of models if you're mixing CC, Codex, and Gemini, something I do advise doing) and reading the same AGENTS dot md file. Simply telling one that it's a frontend agent doesn't make it better at frontend. \n\n---\n\n\"Do you have some traceability between git commit/branch and bead\"\n\nYes, bv automatically does this analysis and links beads to the relevant git commits by analyzing the stream of data and making logical deductions.\n\nDamn, that was a lot of questions! I should start charging for this :)",

Once the plan is turned into beads, agents only need to understand their current bead. \n\nIt's like how a cook in a busy diner can grab a numbered ticket that tells him to make a pastrami on rye sandwich and he can do that perfectly without needing to concern himself with all the intricacies of the dining room and how long each customer has been waiting, who needs to get their check, etc.",

Claude Opus 4.5 in the webapp is also pretty good for helping to make the initial markdown plan, but I still think GPT Pro is the best for this.\n\nI usually also specify the tech stack I want to use. Nowadays, for a web app, it's generally Typescript, Nextjs 16, React 19, Tailwind, Supabase, etc. with anything performance critical being done in rust compiled down to wasm; if it's a CLI tool I usually use Golang or Rust if it's very performance critical. \n\nBTW, I forgot to mention it above, but I like to have a best practices guide in the project folder and reference it in the AGENTS dot md file.\n\nI have a collection of these that are around 6 months out of date, but you can have Claude Code search the web and update them to the latest versions and ask it to read the latest documentation, articles, blog posts, etc. and make revisions:\n\nhttps://t.co/Br4INOoPwo\n\nAlso, when prompting the model to create the initial markdown plan version, I spend a lot of time explaining the goals and intent of the project and detailing the workflows. That is, how you want the final software to work from the standpoint of the user's interactions. The more the model understand about what is you're really trying to accomplish and the end goal and why, it can do a better job for you.",

        "text": "That is an impressively comprehensive guide, that is also better than my current workflow in several ways! There are however a few things that I would still do differently.\n\n1. The initial plan review should take implementation complexity in mind. Should implementation be iterative? Should a skeleton of frontend+backend come first, or should the protocol between them be defined first? What extent of testing would increase likelihood of succeeding?\n\n2. Before using beads, i let the agent describe the relationships between tasks into the tasks, so that e.g. one task about setting up an MVP didn't also implement authentication, since that was already a separate defined task. This was however something I did a couple of months ago, and perhaps opus 4.5 and got 5.2 pro won't mess up like that.\n\n3. One thing that taskmaster does right is the concept of researching tasks, which is something I'm missing here. Which tech stack should be used? Are there existing open source projects that does parts of this? Existing libraries/packages?\n\n4. If each bead is a bit complex then I think it makes sense to document design decisions in markdown, as well as reviewing planned beads to see if there they need to be updated with lessons-learned from the work that was done. A bit like wrapping up your task while things are fresh in context before compacting and starting the next task. However, the part about updating other tasks messed up my attempts to execute tasks in parallel, and I am quite curious about what you think is a good approach (or whether) to incorporate such feedback. It seems like you are doing something similar with agents dot md?\n\n5. Since I like security, for non-trivial apps, I do a security review pass when the high level architecture (interfaces and protocols, basic use cases) are done/known. Concretely this is mostly about defining areas of responsibility, error handling (or even need for fuzzing), logical issues related to parallelization, and similar. Maybe keeping track of what info is known by which part of the system. I'm sure opus and gpt can come up with a good list of things to consider.\n\nSome questions:\n\n6. How do you divide the tasks to your swarm of agents? Do you have an orchestrator agent that executes agents in the background?\n\n7. You say that agents \"introduce themselves\"over email. Do they need individual areas of expertise for this to be efficient, or can there be 10 generalists sending basically the same introduction email?\n\n8. You add testing after implementing a while. Do you have some traceability between git commit/branch and bead so it becomes easier to see what changes were made for one bead, so that testing that bead can be added by an agent with a fresh context window?",

        "text": "I’ve been building a personal assistant system with Kiro AI + Obsidian and wanted to share a bit about how it works and what I’ve learned.\n\nA few goals drove the design:\n\nFirst, I want to monitor how and where I’m spending my time. I have my long-term and short-term goals loaded into the system, and the daily reflection workflow helps me check whether my day-to-day is actually moving in the right direction—and at the right velocity—versus getting stuck in small tactical things.\n\nSecond, I want the system to help me develop personally. I’ve reviewed my performance feedback and built a mental model file that defines my blind spots and relative weaknesses. For example, I’m highly indexed on bias for action, so I need to ensure I’m not evaluating all people and situations through that lens. The reflection workflow references this so I’m regularly checking myself.\n\nThird, I want more substantial meetings and reviews. By prepping me ahead of calls and 1:1s with the latest context—recent notes, open threads, coaching history—I can skip the “getting caught up” phase and focus on strategic or development-related discussion.\n\nFourth, I want continuity across time horizons. Daily reflections roll up to weekly reports, which roll up to monthly and annual synthesis. Patterns that are invisible day-to-day become obvious over weeks and months. Which programs are consuming disproportionate time? What tactical fires keep recurring? Hard to see in the moment, easier in aggregate.\n\nFinally, I want to capture institutional knowledge. Meeting notes, decisions, coaching conversations—all tagged and linked to hub pages for each person and program. Six months from now when I need to remember why something was decided, it’s there.\n\nThe goal isn’t really to save time on small things, though that happens. It’s to make better, more comprehensive decisions and ensure my time goes to the highest-impact work.\n\nHere’s how it works:",

        "text": "This got almost a million views. I am introducing myself. \n\nHi 👋 I’m Rohan Anil. I do research at Anthropic.\n\nI left Google DeepMind in January 2025, where I led work on the Gemini models (leaving as a Distinguished Engineer for contributions to Gemini pretraining).\n\nBefore that, I worked at Google Brain on foundational research in training algorithms as well as infrastructure—for example, the first Transformers inference at Google, and the first large-scale TPU training and inference ex shipping models for core services (including early large-scale neural network models in Search like RankBrain and DeepRank, as well as Ads and Translate). Before Brain, I was on the Sibyl team doing large-scale machine learning. Earlier in my career, I worked on low-level performance engineering for Google’s core servers (including a memory allocator that is part of nearly every Google server call).\n\nI had the opportunity to work with amazing engineers and researchers at Brain, including @geoffreyhinton , @JeffDean, @GuptaVineetG, @GeorgeEDahl Manfred Warmut, Yonghui Wu, Claire Cui, Sanjiv Kumar, Tal Shaked and many others.\n\nOn X, I’m known for the Shampoo algorithm and Gemini Flash because I care a lot about efficiency and have talked about it obsessively. For Shampoo, I felt the community didn’t give it its due (and ICLR AC acting irresponsibly) until a few years ago.\n\nBack to the tweet, when I say this can compress six years of work into a few months, I mean it especially on the engineering side: performance work, and cobbling together distributed systems under real constraints. And I can be honest with myself: I didn’t work on truly novel insights until I moved into neural network research, and even then it was standing on the shoulders of giants.",
