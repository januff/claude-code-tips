I know too many notes!!\n\nEarly results are significant.  Its going to change the way in which Claude Code can interact with Obsidian\n\nThe way I see it, there are three ways Claude can connect to your vault:\n\nFilesystem (MCP or bash)  reads/writes markdown files. Covers maybe 40% of what Obsidian actually knows. No awareness of backlinks, tags, properties, or the graph. To search content, it has to open every file individually.\n\nREST API MCP — talks to Obsidian via plugin. Gets you to about 55%. Better search, some metadata. But fragile setup and limited.\n\nObsidian CLI ...Yay @obsdmd and @kepano !!  it queries Obsidian's actual indexes.  This would be about 85% of Obsidian's capabilities. The missing 15% is purely visual the  canvas layout, graph view rendering, live preview. Everything else is there: search, backlinks, orphan detection, properties, tags with hierarchy and counts.\n\nThe speed difference is real:\n\nFinding orphan notes: bash grep 15.6s  vs CLI 0.26s (54× faster)\nSearching vault: bash grep 1.95s vs  CLI 0.32s (6× faster)\nToken cost for orphan detection via MCP:  about 7 million tokens. Via CLI:  100 tokens. That's 70,000× cheaper.\n\nThe CLI uses Obsidian's pre-built search index the same thing that makes Obsidian's own search instant. Grep scans every file from scratch every time.\n\nThe catch: right now this only works via Claude Code (which can run CLI commands through bash). Claude Desktop and https://t.co/HDaY98Jfm2 can't access it directly. There is an early CLI MCP server (obsidian-ts-mcp) that would bridge this gap  but I  haven't tested it yet. (I think that if you ask nicely Claude Code could create a version for you!)\n\nI'm using this as part of a research assistant stack connecting Claude to Obsidian, Zotero, PubMed and more.

(I eventually turned this into a /wrap command I run at the end of every session.)\n\nAfter a few days I realized: I have project-level notes across everything I'm working on. Those could roll up into a single daily note pretty easily. So I told Claude to summarize the project workbenches into a daily log. Took about two minutes to set up.\n\nThen I started doing my weekly review for the week. I already had seven daily summaries sitting there. \n\nInstead of manually going over my calendar and task list like usual, I made a command that pulls from those and drafts the first version of my weekly review — what got done, what's stuck, what to prioritize next week. \n\nThen I realized: I also have a file with my goals and priorities, and now I have a summary of how I actually spent my week. Why am I manually eyeballing whether those line up? \n\nI told Claude to audit them — compare what I said I'd focus on against what I actually did, and flag the gaps.\n\nThe gaps then inform what I need to work on next week. If I decide to reprioritize, I can tell Claude to update my quarterly goals and weekly boals based on the new priorities.\n\nBecause it has access to my Google Calendar, it can pretty easily check whether I actually have time for what I'm planning.\n\nYou can imagine how you could build more on top of this:\n\nE.g. Send the team weekly update — make a command that takes the weekly review and reformats it for a team audience. Different tone, more context for people who aren't in my head all day. The raw material is already there.\n\nNone of these steps were planned in advance. Each was a small, obvious extension of the last primitive. \n\n- Daily note = summary of project workbenches. \n- Weekly review = summary of daily notes. \n- Goals audit = cross-reference of two files that already existed.\n\nEach piece took a few minutes to set up because the building blocks were already there. \n\nThat's the thing that's both impressive hard to convey about these CLI tools — while some single steps are impressive (e.g. the ability to one shot complex software), the more interesting and exciting thing to me is the ways they compound over time.","author":{"handle":"@TaylorPearsonMe","name":"Taylor Pearson"},"created_at":"2026-02-09T18:42:49.000Z","url":"https://x.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/2020931408588570833","metrics":{"replies":22,"retweets":10,"likes":226,"bookmarks":285,"views":18459,"quotes":1},"engagement_score":882,"conversation_id":"2020931408588570833","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":null,"urls":[]},{"id":"2018745809056207266","text":"this is hands-down the best way to work with Claude right now...\n\nwhenever you start a new project (startup, content, side hustle, anything...)\n\nopen a fresh chat with Opus 4.5, turn on extended thinking and dump everything about your project\n\nthen prompt this:\n\"ask me 5 questions that would help you have a complete understanding of this project\"\n\nanswer those questions (spend a lot of time here)\n\nthen hit it with:\n\"you're my co-founder. create a master plan with a knowledge base directory for each section. attach context markdown files to every part. you're building the skeleton that Claude Code will use to build everything 10x faster. suggest skills to integrate, automations to build or any tool that'd 10x our speed. suggest when to use a project or Claude Code\"\n\nClaude will create every file you need, simply import them into Claude Code\n\nfrom there you build systems and your project alongside it, use it like a Claude chat\n\nit'll tell you when to spin up Claude Projects for specific tasks: deep research, writing, working with MCPs...\n\none planning session replaces weeks of figuring things out on your own\n\nthis is what working WITH AI looks like","author":{"handle":"@EXM7777","name":"Machina"},"created_at":"2026-02-03T17:58:02.000Z","url":"https://x.com/EXM7777/status/2018745809056207266","metrics":{"replies":60,"retweets":139,"likes":2776,"bookmarks":6330,"views":171426,"quotes":6},"engagement_score":15894,"conversation_id":"2018745809056207266","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":null,"urls":[]},{"id":"2018221220160827828","text":"I tested every Claude Code skills and one DESTROYED the rest: \"Planning with files\".\n\nThis skill is literally a cheat code.

I HIGHLY RECCOMEND every Claude Code user implement this into their own workflows. \n\nDo you have a feature you want to implement in an existing project without re-explaining things? As we all know, the more relevant context a chat session has, the more effectively it will be able to implement your request. Why not utilize the knowledge gained from your hundreds/thousands of other Claude code sessions? Don't let that valuable context go to waste!!\n\nThis is where smart forking comes into play. Invoke the /fork-detect tool and tell it what you're wanting to do.

Subagents - Direct buff. Frequently very useful for preventing context rot and ad-hoc specialisation. Sorta adjacent to RLM. IMO, it's good bc as agents get smarter they very effectively allocate subagents. Bitter-lesson adjacent. Simple to use w not much variation - \"use subagents when needed\". Half as useful as much more complex setups (multi-agent) for much less complexity.\n2. Metaprompting - I made a metaprompting claude command to expand my task requests into full prompt files + scratchpad. I take 3 minutes to prompt a 20-minute task. Also generally a direct buff. You should usually read the metaprompt plan, but improves stability and sanity-checks assumptions anyway.\n3. Asking the user more at the beginning - Generally direct buff, but u have to answer questions in plan mode. A little non-transparent bc i can't tell if it's not asking bc it understands, the command is off or has no questions.\n4. \"Thinking\" prompts - Generally a buff and easy to toss in, but not-transparent and is sorta getting phased out per Boris.\n-----below are useful, but high skill floor------\n5. Long-running agents - The main thing is you have to think a bit to be able to prompt and set this up well. Basically you have to understand the shape and tradeoff of a 15 minute task before you understand the shape of a 1.5 hour or 4 hour task. Or whether to do four 15 minute tasks or one 1-hour task. And It takes some tweaking and is obv very long trial-and-error. Fundamentally tho, it's usually the same setup \"but go longer in a useful way\".\n6. Parallel multi- agent - I think this is very high-variance, and only useful on highly complex or highly well-segmented/scoped tasks or very very experienced setups. If 2 tasks take 10 minutes and you spend an arbitrary amount of time prompting or god forbid, merge changes, it's counterproductive. If u have a good scaffold for this tho, prolly very good, you just prolly won't get there with parallel multi-agent. High skill floor and skill ceiling vs the direct buffs above.\n7. Role-based multi-agent - It can work, but I am on principle bearish on this. Models just evolve too fast for hard-coded heuristics unless the arbitrage is very high. Also hard to test. I've seen people swear by Codex planner + Opus executor which probably works. Idk, maybe skill issue?\n8. Computer Use Agents - I think this is hard to do bc it plays at a very long tail of tasks. You're getting models to do something they were definitely not even meant to do a year ago. As a paradigm, very early and requires wrangling. @hud_evals will cook here, tho.\n\n(MCP/search agents I feel is more a situation-dependent tool to fetch from data sources that otherwise wouldn't exist at all.

They critique it in parallel. Then Claude synthesizes the feedback, adds its own critique, and revises. This loops until every model agrees the spec is solid.\n\nWhat actually happens in practice: requirements that seemed clear get challenged. Missing error handling gets flagged. Security gaps surface. Scope creep gets caught. One model says \"what about X?\" and another says \"the API contract is incomplete\" and Claude adds \"you haven't defined what happens when Y fails.\"\n\nBy the time all models agree, your spec has survived adversarial review from multiple perspectives.\n\nFeatures:\n- Interview mode: optional deep-dive Q&A before drafting to capture requirements upfront\n- Early agreement checks: if a model agrees too fast, it gets pressed to prove it actually read the doc\n- User review period: after consensus, you can request changes or run another cycle\n- PRD to tech spec flow: finish a PRD, then continue straight into a technical spec based on it\n- Telegram integration: get notified on your phone, inject feedback from anywhere\n\nWorks with OpenAI, Google, xAI, Mistral, Groq, Deepseek. Leveraging more models results in stricter convergence.\n\nIf you're building something and writing specs anyway, this makes them better.\n\nCheck it out and let me know what you think!\n\nhttps://t.co/OrFf5HUI10","author":{"handle":"@0xzak","name":"zak.eth"},"created_at":"2026-01-11T04:53:13.000Z","url":"https://x.com/0xzak/status/2010213382494798108","metrics":{"replies":78,"retweets":69,"likes":1183,"bookmarks":1883,"views":81665,"quotes":28},"engagement_score":5321,"conversation_id":"2010213382494798108","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":{"url":"https://t.co/OrFf5HUI10","title":"GitHub - zscole/adversarial-spec: A Claude Code plugin that iteratively refines product specifica...","description":"A Claude Code plugin that iteratively refines product specifications by debating between multiple LLMs until all models reach consensus. - zscole/adversarial-spec"},"urls":[]},{"id":"2009963629500870977","text":"Introducing Claude Delegator!\n\nA Claude Code plugin that lets you use GPT 5.2 powered subagents directly within Claude Code.\n\nAsk GPT 5.2 (via codex) to architect your code, perform security audits, or make any other changes to your codebase.\n\nEasy installation guide below ↓ https://t.co/9Wf0OX2399","author":{"handle":"@jarrodwatts","name":"Jarrod Watts"},"created_at":"2026-01-10T12:20:47.000Z","url":"https://x.com/jarrodwatts/status/2009963629500870977","metrics":{"replies":98,"retweets":145,"likes":1897,"bookmarks":2594,"views":159987,"quotes":24},"engagement_score":7669,"conversation_id":"2009963629500870977","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[{"type":"photo","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-TSIExasAMoaVT.jpg","expanded_url":"https://x.com/jarrodwatts/status/2009963629500870977/photo/1","alt_text":null,"video_url":null}],"card":null,"urls":[]},{"id":"2009475420282826781","text":"Claud Code创始人@bcherny 一小时前开源了Anthropic 内部使用的 code-simplifier 插件 —— Claude Code 团队自己用的代码简化神器。\n\n它能做什么：\n→ 减少不必要的复杂性和嵌套\n→ 消除冗余代码和过度抽象\n→ 自动应用项目代码规范\n→ 保留所有功能，只优化实现\n\n最狠的是： 它用 Opus 模型，在你写完代码后自动介入，无需手动触发。\n\n安装只需一行：\nclaude plugin install code-simplifier\n\n或在会话中：\n/plugin install code-simplifier\n\n长 coding session 结束后，让它帮你清理战场。复杂 PR 提交前，让它先过一遍。\n\n代码不是写给机器的，是写给 6 个月后的你自己看的。","author":{"handle":"@AI_Skiller","name":"roger"},"created_at":"2026-01-09T04:00:49.000Z","url":"https://x.com/AI_Skiller/status/2009475420282826781","metrics":{"replies":12,"retweets":115,"likes":700,"bookmarks":911,"views":71389,"quotes":6},"engagement_score":2788,"conversation_id":"2009475420282826781","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":null,"urls":[]},{"id":"2009620498573873379","text":"Another interesting feature in Claude Code 2.1\n\nSkills are visible by default using / (just like commands).\n\nYes, this can be confusing at first, but with a solid naming convention it’s easy to manage.\n\nIf you want to hide a Skill so it’s not visible to users, add this to the skill frontmatter: \nuser-invocable: false\n\nWays Skills can be invoked:\n- user-invocable: true (default): users can invoke it directly\n- user-invocable: false: Claude can use it, but users shouldn’t\n- disable-model-invocation: true: users can invoke it, but Claude won’t do so programmatically\n\nAlso worth noting: subagents can invoke Skills too.\n\nUsing Claude Code is easy... designing well-structured, autonomous workflows is a different level entirely.\n\nComing soon: a degree in Claude Code Engineering 😄","author":{"handle":"@dani_avila7","name":"Daniel San"},"created_at":"2026-01-09T13:37:18.000Z","url":"https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/2009620498573873379","metrics":{"replies":19,"retweets":18,"likes":207,"bookmarks":183,"views":71191,"quotes":3},"engagement_score":666,"conversation_id":"2009620498573873379","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[{"type":"photo","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-Oa5xiWQAAEkFq.jpg","expanded_url":"https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/2009620498573873379/photo/1","alt_text":null,"video_url":null}],"card":null,"urls":[]},{"id":"2004018525569274049","text":"https://t.co/aPnhSXqZPQ\n\ncontinuous claude  v2 is now up - a setup designed to tackle the scarcest resource in coding: context\n\nexplaining the reasoning behind features below ↓","author":{"handle":"@parcadei","name":"dei"},"created_at":"2025-12-25T02:37:04.000Z","url":"https://x.com/parcadei/status/2004018525569274049","metrics":{"replies":47,"retweets":67,"likes":1021,"bookmarks":1979,"views":330348,"quotes":22},"engagement_score":5254,"conversation_id":"2004018525569274049","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":{"url":"https://t.co/aPnhSXqZPQ","title":"GitHub - parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3: Context management for Claude Code.

The best part is that you can start a fresh conversation in ChatGPT and do it all again once Claude Code or Codex finishes integrating your last batch of suggested revisions. \n\nAfter four or five rounds of this, you tend to reach a steady-state where the suggestions become very incremental. \n\n(Note: I was originally planning to end this post here, but thought it would be helpful for people to see this part in the larger context of the entire workflow I recommend using all my tooling)\n\nThen you're ready to turn the plan into beads (think of these as epics/tasks/subtasks and associated dependency structure. The name comes from Steve Yegge's amazing project, which is like Jira or Linear, but optimized for use by coding agents), which I do with this prompt using Claude Code with Opus 4.5:\n\n---\nOK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our \"future self\" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.)  Use only the `bd` tool to create and modify the beads and add the dependencies. Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nAfter it finished all of that, I then do a round of this prompt (if CC did a compaction at any point, be sure to tell it to re-read your AGENTS dot md file):\n\n---\nCheck over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in \"plan space\" before we start implementing these things!  Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nThen you're ready to start implementing. The fastest way to do that is to start up a big swarm of agents that coordinate using my MCP Agent Mail project. \n\nThen you can simply create a bunch of sessions using Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI in different windows or panes in tmux (or use my ntm project which tries to abstract and automate some of this) in your project folder at once and give them the following as their marching orders (for this to work well, you need to make sure that your AGENTS dot md file has the right blurbs to explain each of the tools; I'll include a complete example of this in a reply to this post):\n\n---\nFirst read ALL of the AGENTS dot md file and README dot md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents. \n\nBe sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.\n\nDon't get stuck in \"communication purgatory\" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. \n\nWhen you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS dot md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nIf you've done a good job creating your beads, the agents will be able to get a decent sized chunk of work done in that first pass. Then, before they start moving to the next bead, I have them review all their work with this:\n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with \"fresh eyes\" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nI keep running rounds of that until they stop finding bugs. Eventually they'll need to do a compaction, so if they do that, right after hit them with this (note that I've been typing AGENTS dot md to avoid the annoying preview on X because it thinks it's a website; you can replace that with a period and remove the spaces if you want; the agents don't care either way):\n\n---\nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.     \n---\n\nWhen the reviews come up clean, have them move on to the next bead:\n\n--- \nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.   Use bv with the robot flags (see AGENTS dot md for info on this) to find the most impactful bead(s) to work on next and then start on it. Remember to mark the beads appropriately and communicate with your fellow agents. Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work. And respond to any agent mail messages you've received. \n---\n\nWhen all your beads are completed, you might want to run one of these prompts:\n\n---\nDo we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nI still think there are strong opportunities to enhance the UI/UX look and feel and to make everything work better and be more intuitive, user-friendly, visually appealing, polished, slick, and world class in terms of following UI/UX best practices like those used by Stripe, don't you agree? And I want you to carefully consider desktop UI/UX and mobile UI/UX separately while doing this and hyper-optimize for both separately to play to the specifics of each modality. I'm looking for true world-class visual appeal, polish, slickness, etc. that makes people gasp at how stunning and perfect it is in every way.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nAnd then start the process again of implementing the beads. When you're done with all that and have solid test coverage, you can then keep doing rounds of these two prompts until they consistently come back clean with no changes made:\n\n---\nI want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by.\n\nOnce you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with \"fresh eyes\" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them. \n\nBe sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS dot md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS dot md file. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nand\n\n---\nOk can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary? Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nYou should also periodically have one of the agents run this as you're going to commit your work:\n\n---\nNow, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nIf you simply use these tools, workflows, and prompts in the way I just described, you can create really incredible software in a just a couple days, sometimes in just one day. \n\nI've done it a bunch of times now in the past few weeks and it really does work, as crazy as that may sound. You see my GitHub profile for the proof of this. It looks like the output from a team of 100+ developers. \n\nThe frontier models and coding agent harnesses really are that good already, they just need this extra level of tooling and prompting and workflows to reach their full potential.\n\nTo learn more about my system (which is absolutely free and 100% open-source), check out:\n\nhttps://t.co/22Fy2w73x0\n\nIt include a complete tutorial that shows anyone how to get start with this process. You don't even need to know much at all about computers; you just need the desire to learn and some grit and determination. And about $500/month for the Claude Max and GPT Pro subscriptions, plus another $50 or so for the cloud server.\n\nIf you want to change the entire direction of your life, it has truly never been easier. If you think you might want to do it, I really recommend just immersing yourself. \n\nOnce you get Claude Code up and running on the cloud server, you basically have an ultra competent friend who can help you with any other problems you encounter. \n\nAnd I will personally answer your questions or problems if you reach out to me on X or on GitHub issues (it might be Claude impersonating me though, lol).","author":{"handle":"@doodlestein","name":"Jeffrey Emanuel"},"created_at":"2026-01-03T23:04:20.000Z","url":"https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2007588870662107197","metrics":{"replies":41,"retweets":47,"likes":761,"bookmarks":1926,"views":69875,"quotes":9},"engagement_score":4830,"conversation_id":"2007588870662107197","is_reply":false,"in_reply_to":null,"media":[],"card":{"url":"https://t.co/22Fy2w73x0","title":"Agent Flywheel - AI Agents Coding For You","description":"Transform a fresh VPS into a fully-configured agentic coding environment in ~30 minutes.

I think Obsidian as a concept is extremely cool.

I respect it. I think it's cool, and they can show me some amazing stuff that they can do with it. I'm thinking of @pedramamini as one of the heads of this pack, by the way. Absolutely absolutely brilliant stuff that he does with it.\n\nBut to me, ever since probably mid-2023, I have thought that because of what we can do with AI and the fact that text has become primary, a tool like Obsidian becomes a UI issue rather than underlying primitive. \n\nTo me, text is the primitive. And Obsidian just becomes a UI layer on top of states and relationships that I want to see. In other words, I feel like I should just be able to express what I want to get out of Obsidian as context in a series of prompts, etc. And my AI system should be able to generate the output that I'm looking for. Ideally, my AI system should be able to generate any UI. It should be able to generate an Obsidian-like experience. It should be able to make me a web app. It should be able to do it on the mobile phone. Do you know what I mean? \n\nI feel people are confusing the Obsidian tool itself for its functionality, and not realizing that the functionality is what we care about and that the fact that it's inside of a tool is actually a constraint rather than capability. \n\nIs there anyone else that sees it in this way?
