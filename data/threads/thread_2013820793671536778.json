Or what time zone you are in. \n\nSo when you do date time operations of ANY kind, as simple as saving something to your calendar, things get weird fast. \n\nMy early solution has stuck thru every iteration of my JFDI system and it's dummy simple:\n\nI use Claude Code hooks to run a bash script that generates current date time, timezone of host device, friendly day of week etc. \n\nInjects it silently into context. \n\nI never see it but date time issues vanish. 3+ most battle tested. \n\nKinda wild that this isn't baked in @bcherny (thank you for CC btw it changed my life no exaggerating)",
