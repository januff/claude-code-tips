    "text": "The current tactics for using AI coding agents well are roughly:\n\n1. Give agents tools to self-verify\n\n\u2022 MCP servers (agent-browser, playwright)\n\u2022 tests\n\u2022 tsc, linters\n\n2. Teach agents to build their own verification tools\n\nAgents can write their own scripts, skills, subagents, eval frameworks, plans, and success criteria.\n\nIf you don't know what to ask, ask the agent: \"what tools will you need to know you've done a good job?\"\n\n3. Point the agent back at itself\n\n\u2022 Turn complex workflows into reusable skills/subagents \u2014 after finishing a long session, ask the agent if there's anything you could extract into reusable skills.\n\u2022 Ask the agent to rewrite your prompts to be more clear\n\u2022 Use multiple models to evaluate each other (especially useful for evaluating plans + code review before a PR)\n\u2022 If a skill doesn't quite work, finish the task anyway, then feed the conversation back so it can improve the skill's instructions\n\u2022 If the agent asks you to do something manually, ask yourself: how do I teach the agent to answer this question on its own?\n\u2022 You can teach the agent to self-improve by writing meta-skills that update other skills/rules based on what worked (or didn't) as you close PRs.\n\n4. Give better context\n\n\u2022 Attach screenshots\n\u2022 Link to docs/blog posts\n\u2022 Tell the agent to read source code for OSS dependencies\n\u2022 Link to examples of high-quality outcomes it should emulate\n\nAnd if you don't know how to do anything above\u2014ask the agent.",
