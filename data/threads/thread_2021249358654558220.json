    "text": "The state of the Internet in a nutshell: For 2.5 years, whenever I published a video on YouTube, I'd come up with a bespoke title / thumbnail that accurately described what the conversation was about. \n\nThen, during the summer, my view count fell. Nothing worked until I found a formula: \"How to Write ________ Well.\" \n\nAlways the same text. Throw an adverb in the middle, then share a quote from the interview in the thumbnail. People are 0.5% - 1% more likely to click on that title format, so the channel has exploded in growth. \n\nThis title format is worse for my viewers and soul-deadening for me, but it's leading to so many more views that I'd be crazy not to follow it \u2014 and people are significantly more likely to click on videos with the formulaic title. \n\nThis isn't just a story about YouTube. So much of the Internet works like this now.",
