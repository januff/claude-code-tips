Here's the layered answer for your setup:\n\n  How Claude searches your vault:\n\n  1. Keyword search (primary) - Grep/Glob through files. Fast, exact matches. Works great for finding specific sessions, commands, file paths.\n\n  2.  Structured organization - The YYYY/MM-Month/DD/ folder structure + session logs mean I can navigate temporally (\"what did we do yesterday?\") without needing search at all.\n\n  Draft reply for Viktor:\n\n  Three layers actually:\n  1. Keyword search via grep/glob (fast, exact)\n  2.  Temporal navigation via folder structure (YYYY/MM/DD)\n\n  Most context restoration is actually #2 - Claude reads today's session log first, then yesterday's if needed. Embeddings are more for \"did we solve this before?\" type queries.\"",
