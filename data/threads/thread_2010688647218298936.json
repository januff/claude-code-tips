    "text": "My Beginner Tierlist of Agent Abstractions (for Claude):\n1. Subagents - Direct buff. Frequently very useful for preventing context rot and ad-hoc specialisation. Sorta adjacent to RLM. IMO, it's good bc as agents get smarter they very effectively allocate subagents. Bitter-lesson adjacent. Simple to use w not much variation - \"use subagents when needed\". Half as useful as much more complex setups (multi-agent) for much less complexity.\n2. Metaprompting - I made a metaprompting claude command to expand my task requests into full prompt files + scratchpad. I take 3 minutes to prompt a 20-minute task. Also generally a direct buff. You should usually read the metaprompt plan, but improves stability and sanity-checks assumptions anyway.\n3. Asking the user more at the beginning - Generally direct buff, but u have to answer questions in plan mode. A little non-transparent bc i can't tell if it's not asking bc it understands, the command is off or has no questions.\n4. \"Thinking\" prompts - Generally a buff and easy to toss in, but not-transparent and is sorta getting phased out per Boris.\n-----below are useful, but high skill floor------\n5. Long-running agents - The main thing is you have to think a bit to be able to prompt and set this up well. Basically you have to understand the shape and tradeoff of a 15 minute task before you understand the shape of a 1.5 hour or 4 hour task. Or whether to do four 15 minute tasks or one 1-hour task. And It takes some tweaking and is obv very long trial-and-error. Fundamentally tho, it's usually the same setup \"but go longer in a useful way\".\n6. Parallel multi- agent - I think this is very high-variance, and only useful on highly complex or highly well-segmented/scoped tasks or very very experienced setups. If 2 tasks take 10 minutes and you spend an arbitrary amount of time prompting or god forbid, merge changes, it's counterproductive. If u have a good scaffold for this tho, prolly very good, you just prolly won't get there with parallel multi-agent. High skill floor and skill ceiling vs the direct buffs above.\n7. Role-based multi-agent - It can work, but I am on principle bearish on this. Models just evolve too fast for hard-coded heuristics unless the arbitrage is very high. Also hard to test. I've seen people swear by Codex planner + Opus executor which probably works. Idk, maybe skill issue?\n8. Computer Use Agents - I think this is hard to do bc it plays at a very long tail of tasks. You're getting models to do something they were definitely not even meant to do a year ago. As a paradigm, very early and requires wrangling. @hud_evals will cook here, tho.\n\n(MCP/search agents I feel is more a situation-dependent tool to fetch from data sources that otherwise wouldn't exist at all. And p much all production agent scaffolds have this now. ig if you're pedantic, they're top tier bc theyre the default)",
