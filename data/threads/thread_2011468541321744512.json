    "text": "Agent coding life hack:\n\nBefore having Claude Code create a skill dot md file for you (which you should probably be doing a couple times a day at least), tell it to read this guide first:\n\nhttps://t.co/T3Gq12ZOR1\n\nIt makes the skills way better. \n\nSo why should you be making skills, anyway? \n\nWell, every time you find yourself doing something more than once across projects, it\u2019s a good candidate for a new skill.\n\nI\u2019ll give you two examples from my work in the past day:\n\n1) When you have a website and want to share links on X, Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, iMessage, you want them to show that nice preview. I used to manually explain that to the agent and point it to one of my other projects as an example. But now I have this skill:\n\nhttps://t.co/JSrg76O92M\n\n2) I always need to write README files for my new projects on GitHub. I used to tell it to use another project as a model, but now it will just know to use this skill:\n\nhttps://t.co/6VeFMWU43b\n\nNote that both of those skills make use of additional reference files that are included in the same directory as the skill dot md file. \n\nThis is a good best practice for better token efficiency through progressive disclosure.\n\nBut you don\u2019t actually need to know any of that stuff if you tell Claude to read that skills best practices guide I linked to above!\n\nSeriously, don\u2019t sleep on skills, they\u2019re an amazing idea and very well supported by the latest version of Claude Code.",
