    "text": "tonight i did something wild\n\ni told my ai to watch a youtube video, learn how to become a better ai assistant, then upgrade itself\n\nand it worked\n\nhere's exactly what happened:\n\nive been seeing @AlexFinn's tweets about his clawdbot \"henry\" \u2014 an ai that builds apps while he sleeps, sends morning briefs, and ships code 24/7\n\ninstead of watching the 35 min @gregisenberg interview myself, i told my clawdbot:\n\n\"go find alex finn's exact workflow and then copy that\"\n\nwithin 20 minutes my ai:\n\n\u2022 searched google and x for alex's posts\n\u2022 found the podcast \"clawdbot clearly explained\"\n\u2022 extracted the key setup: morning briefs, overnight builds, mission control task board\n\u2022 identified the proactivity prompts\n\u2022 updated its own system files\n\u2022 built itself a jarvis-style visual interface\n\u2022 set up email + calendar integration (i just authorized oauth)\n\nthe result? i now have an ai employee that:\n\n\u2192 sends me morning briefs with email + calendar summary\n\u2192 builds one small improvement every night while i sleep\n\u2192 tracks its own tasks in a \"mission control\" board\n\u2192 creates prs for review (never commits directly)\n\u2192 has safety rails: won't delete files, won't send emails without approval\n\nthe craziest part?\n\ni gave it ONE instruction: \"go research how alex finn set up his clawdbot and do that\"\n\nit figured out the rest\n\nthis is the shift from \"vibe coding\" to \"vibe orchestration\"\n\nyou're not coding anymore. you're not even prompting anymore\n\nyou're managing\n\n__\n\nif you want to try this yourself, here's the setup:\n\n1. install clawdbot (https://t.co/REskgPUoCr) or moltbot\n2. run it on a mac mini that stays on 24/7\n3. feed it context about you and your business\n4. give it the proactivity mandate:\n\n\"i am a 1 man business. i work from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to sleep. i need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. please take everything you know about me and just do work you think would make my life easier or improve my business. i want to wake up every morning and be like 'wow, you got a lot done while i was sleeping.' just create prs for me to review, don't push anything live. i'll test and commit\"\n\n5. tell it to build something every night:\n\n\"every night while i sleep, build me something small that improves our workflow. keep the scope small but helpful. i want to wake up surprised\"\n\nthat's it. now you have a 24/7 ai employee\n\nthe future isn't ai that waits for instructions\n\nit's ai that figures out what needs to be done and does it\n\n(while you sleep)",
