    "text": "The most interesting thing about Claude Code is the extensibility \u2014 small things can easily compound into bigger things you didn't plan.\n\nI started telling Claude Code to write project notes at the end of each work session: What got done, decisions made, open questions, etc.\n\nThis is a practice I've had for a long time, just a way to make it easy to pick up where I left off. \n\nIt writes the notes itself into a file so I don't even have to write it anymore which is already really nice. (I eventually turned this into a /wrap command I run at the end of every session.)\n\nAfter a few days I realized: I have project-level notes across everything I'm working on. Those could roll up into a single daily note pretty easily. So I told Claude to summarize the project workbenches into a daily log. Took about two minutes to set up.\n\nThen I started doing my weekly review for the week. I already had seven daily summaries sitting there. \n\nInstead of manually going over my calendar and task list like usual, I made a command that pulls from those and drafts the first version of my weekly review \u2014 what got done, what's stuck, what to prioritize next week. \n\nThen I realized: I also have a file with my goals and priorities, and now I have a summary of how I actually spent my week. Why am I manually eyeballing whether those line up? \n\nI told Claude to audit them \u2014 compare what I said I'd focus on against what I actually did, and flag the gaps.\n\nThe gaps then inform what I need to work on next week. If I decide to reprioritize, I can tell Claude to update my quarterly goals and weekly boals based on the new priorities.\n\nBecause it has access to my Google Calendar, it can pretty easily check whether I actually have time for what I'm planning.\n\nYou can imagine how you could build more on top of this:\n\nE.g. Send the team weekly update \u2014 make a command that takes the weekly review and reformats it for a team audience. Different tone, more context for people who aren't in my head all day. The raw material is already there.\n\nNone of these steps were planned in advance. Each was a small, obvious extension of the last primitive. \n\n- Daily note = summary of project workbenches. \n- Weekly review = summary of daily notes. \n- Goals audit = cross-reference of two files that already existed.\n\nEach piece took a few minutes to set up because the building blocks were already there. \n\nThat's the thing that's both impressive hard to convey about these CLI tools \u2014 while some single steps are impressive (e.g. the ability to one shot complex software), the more interesting and exciting thing to me is the ways they compound over time.",

I've been building something similar with my OpenClaw, I,Claudius: Daily memory files, project scratchpads, error logs, but I hadn't wired up the rollup chain you're describing. That's the missing piece.\n\nWhat's interesting to me is extending this beyond just session notes. I'm layering in premortems before any content or marketing build, tracking what actually worked vs what we assumed would work, and logging the patterns we're seeing across multiple projects. The compounding isn't just in the summaries; it's in the pattern recognition. When you can cross-reference three months of daily notes against your quarterly goals and see exactly where you drifted, that's a different kind of awareness than any weekly review gives you manually.\n\nThe \"summaries all the way down\" framing is right, but I'd add: it's also lessons all the way down. Each layer should be getting smarter, not just shorter.",

Every session leaves behind structured notes that any teammate (human or AI) can pick up later. No more \"what happened while I was offline\" Slack scrolling.\n\nThe real unlock is when these notes become institutional memory that survives context switches, timezone gaps, and even team turnover. Remote teams who build this habit now will have a massive edge.",
