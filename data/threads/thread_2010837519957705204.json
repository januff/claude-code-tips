For transactions that were unusual, I could get it to search my email to find relevant invoices since that integration was built.\n\nSo now I tend to approach tasks by asking, can OpenCode do this? Could it do it if I provide the right SKILL and CLI command that calls the right API? If you can extend it like that, then it can be quite a useful tool.\n\nThe tricky part is all the authentication. I was thinking about how to set this up for a friend and realised it's quite hard if you can't set up the auth / API calls for the major services you use, which a lot of non-technical people would struggle with.",
