    "text": "holy shit it fucking WORKS. \n\nSMART FORKING. My mind is genuinely blown. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND every Claude Code user implement this into their own workflows. \n\nDo you have a feature you want to implement in an existing project without re-explaining things? As we all know, the more relevant context a chat session has, the more effectively it will be able to implement your request. Why not utilize the knowledge gained from your hundreds/thousands of other Claude code sessions? Don't let that valuable context go to waste!!\n\nThis is where smart forking comes into play. Invoke the /fork-detect tool and tell it what you're wanting to do. It will then run your prompt through an embedding model, cross reference the embedding with a vectorized RAG database containing every single one of your previous chat sessions (which auto updates as you continue to have more sessions). \n\nIt will then return a list of the top 5 relevant chat sessions you've had relating to what you're wanting to do, assigning each a relevance score - ordering it from highest to lowest. You then pick which session you prefer to fork from, and it gives you the fork command to copy and paste into a new terminal. \n\nAnd boom, there you have it. Seamlessly efficient feature implementation. \n\nHappy to whip up an implementation plan & share it in a git repo if anyone is interested!",

    "text": "Many such cases in this space for sure. Although so far in practice it's actually proven to be very useful. I did make a couple tweaks & additions though. I changed the embedding model from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 as nomic allows 8192 tokens vs MiniLM's 256. (I had MiniLM already running on a daemon as the embedding model for my semantic memory system which worked just fine - but later realized after implementing that my 4KB transcript chunks were being heavily truncated). \n\nThe second thing I did is build a custom /fork.md command with special instructions that \"prime\" the forked session to be a sort of \"context only\" forked continuation of that session. This was necessary because I had realized most sessions I'd be forking have already been compacted and thus lost a lot of the context I needed (which kinda defeated the whole purpose). Plus the forked session would always assume I was picking up where that session last left off - with it wanting to implement things I've already done. So I had to let it know, hey pal relax, you're just a clone and I'm only using you for your context lol.\n\nThe /fork.md command is a ~170 line skill file with conditional instructions based on whether or not the forked session has already been compacted. IF so, it will tell the model to first review it's own compacted summary and conduct a gap analysis in its knowledge. Once the gaps are identified, it will dispatch two sub-agents instructing them to scour the pre-compacted transcript to retrieve the gaps in it's knowledge (I have a pre-compact hook which auto exports the transcript right before compaction, then runs a script on the exported .jsonl to convert it to .md, only extracting the user & system messages along with thinking blocks - and this is what the sub-agents are scouring).  \n\nIt will then combine the agent findings with it's own post-compacted summary and generate a full detailed context report - then ask me what I'd like to work on. \n\nAfter implementing these changes this workflow's been running smooth as butter. Here's some screenshots of the /fork.md for reference:",

    "text": "Excellent question! The solution I built for this very problem involves another parallel phase of my context management/preservation system, which is all about handling seamless context transfer between sessions while maximizing relevancy. Here's how it works:\n\nWhen the session wants to compact, a pre-compact hook fires & auto exports the full transcript & blocks code editing tool usage (with exceptions for updating skills files & issues bash commands to embed new learnings to semantic memory). Compaction happens, Claude tries to continue editing code, gets hit with custom error message telling it to run the /post-compact command (to which it complies). \n\nThis triggers a multi step workflow where Claude will first examine it's own compacted summary, then identify key gaps in its knowledge. It dispatches sub-agents to scour the exported pre-compacted transcript, dynamically instructing them to ingest the self-identified relevant/forgotten context (along with identifying learnings for semantic memory updates). Then the sub-agents returns their findings to the main agent - main agent then executes custom doc update procedures (combining it's implicit post-compacted knowledge of the session with the forgotten details from the sub-agents for maximal accuracy). \n\nOnce done it creates a https://t.co/Eyw2EtHjsm file, then a session-complete flag, then concludes the session. Stop hook fires, which runs bash to trigger VS codes file watcher extension to check for session-complete flag. If detected, it auto spawns a new Claude code terminal and auto pipes in a dynamic prompt through the bash command telling it to follow all instructions in the linked https://t.co/Eyw2EtHjsm file. New session seamlessly picks up where the old session left off & the whole thing requires zero manual intervention. \n\nThe idea here is that doc updates & code edits in a post compacted state are flawed because it forgot all the details and as such, Opus is inclined to make a lot of assumptions. So I solve this by having a pre-compact hook export the transcript JUST before compaction, then using sub-agents to scour the transcript for all the forgotten details. \n\nThe systems a bit heavy - you'll use an extra ~50k tokens just executing these procedures, but the result is well worth it imo. It gives me completely flawless context transfer to a fresh session & its fully automated. \n\nOh by the way, a bit off topic but if you combine this automated context passthrough system with the main elements of the Ralph workflow you get absolutely incredible results. In fact, the entire smart forking system was completely one-shotted with Ralph & this automated context management system. I didn't have to make a single change once it was finished - completely worked as intended out of the box.",

    "text": "Great question! \n\nWith regard to the fresh context window question - \"kinda-ish\". It's not completely fresh because otherwise it's be no different than just manually spawning a new chat session as you'd need to re-explain context. There's context loaded, but it's mostly only context you actually need to get the task done. \n\nThe amount of context depends on whether the ideal session it identified for forking has been compacted or not (for me, 90% of the time they have been). If it has been compacted there will naturally be less context as the chat session only has its compacted summary to go off of. \n\nThis can of course be problematic when you need the details as part of the loaded context - so when you spawn the forked session, there's instructions from the /prime-fork command that identifies whether or not the summary was compacted. If it was, it will instruct the model to critically examine it's own compacted summary & identify any gaps in it's knowledge (missing details). It will then dispatch 2 sub-agents to scour the pre-compacted transcript, instructing them to find and return those forgotten details as it relates to the task you want done. Once done, it will then continue on executing your original task. \n\nIf the session has not been compacted, it will skip the sub-agent step and just go right into executing your task.",
