102. Two Agents for Server Management
Author: @DrFayaa
Tip: I run my home server with two agents. One for server infra and one for app/tool developments. The main md file makes the division of labor very clear. No agent does the work of another. So much so that if I ask the infra agent for app-related tasks, it'd apologize and delegate it
