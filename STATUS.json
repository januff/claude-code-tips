    "FIXED: fetch-bookmarks dedup bug \u2014 created scripts/import_bookmarks.py with Python-set dedup (no shell pipes)",
    "Rewrote /fetch-bookmarks skill as deterministic, prescriptive skill with exact tool calls per phase",
    "Added data/fetch_logs/ for structured import logging",
    "Decision 14: documented dedup bug root cause and architectural fix",
    "Bookmark fetch: 12 NEW tweets imported (SSH support, Obsidian CLI, Excalidraw+MCP, Seedance 2.0, Cowork update, terminal line height, Haiku model remap, self-improve setup, etc.)",
    "Migration COMPLETE: code-tab-as-orchestrator \u2014 updated CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_GUIDE.md, LEARNINGS.md, PROJECT_DECISIONS.md"

  "known_issues": [
    "PROGRESS.md stale (last updated Jan 5)",
    "4 tweets have empty text \u2014 genuinely attachment-only replies, not a parsing bug",
    "Quote tweets not captured in schema or extraction (only quote_count stored)",
    "44 links (41%) still lack LLM summaries \u2014 19 are media URLs (unfetchable), 25 are x.com/tweet links",
    "17+ media items lack vision analysis \u2014 limited by missing local_path",
    "Obsidian v1.11.7 installed \u2014 needs update to 1.12+ for CLI support",
    "/wrap-up command does not include git push \u2014 causes invisible work",
    "Briefing generator produces double @@ in author handles",
    "Pre-compact hook may not capture enough structured context (only STATUS.json)"
