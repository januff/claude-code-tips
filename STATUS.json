    "52 links (57%) still lack LLM summaries — many are t.co/media URLs",
    "17 media items (59%) lack vision analysis — limited by missing local_path",
    "Obsidian v1.11.7 installed — needs update to 1.12+ for CLI support",
    "/wrap-up command does not include git push — causes invisible work",
    "Briefing generator produces double @@ in author handles"
